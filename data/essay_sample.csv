The classroom needs to be ever changing along with the outside world. The iMath project will help students by obtaining classroom subject...",My students need four iPods.,"I am a fourth year fifth grade math teacher. The school I teach in is a fifth and sixth grade public school and is a Title One school which means that 95% of our students get free lunch. Presently, I am in the process of completing a Masters degree in Technology in Education through Lesley University. My coursework through Lesley University is allowing me to continue to be a lifelong learner and allow my students to learn in an environment that they can be successful in. Technology has a huge impact on my students' involvement in the classroom. I would like the opportunity to introduce more technology in the classroom, but I need the help of wonderful people like you. \n\nI would like to introduce to my students the program I call iMath. Through the iMath program I would integrate iPods into my math curriculum. It would allow students to practice their math facts, construct projects, create podcasts, listen to tests, and review lessons. iPods would allow my students to learn on their own, with other classmates, or with the entire class. Having iPods in the classroom would not only encourage students to get excited about learning math, it would also make it easier for me to accommodate students who have special needs. This includes having tests read aloud to them or reviewing the day’s lesson played back on the iPod. \n\nStudents continue to struggle with learning their basic facts. As a teacher, I have tried many different ways to help them learn, including using food, manipulatives, and flash cards. I would like to now venture out and try using innovative technology which is what students use every day. Students are used to playing video games and having technology at their finger tips. Unfortunately, I work in a Title One School and don’t have the funds to purchase the desired technology. With your help I could get the technology needed to change my students' minds about how they feel about math. \n\nIt is imperative that teachers bring technology into the classroom, if students are going to be able to survive in the 21st Century. The classroom needs to be ever changing along with the outside world. The iMath project will help students by obtaining classroom subject proficiency through a wide variety of learning methods while using the iPods. According to an Article in iLearn called 21st Century Literacy, “students learn best when they build critical thinking and problem solving skills instead of memorization.” I want to create a 21st century classroom where students learn to become lifelong learners. Your help will help me reach my goals and my students goals."

Help us do just that by giving us the camera that will record our stories and interpretations! \n\nMy students are all deaf or hard of hearing who are struggling to master reading and language skills at the same time.  My students have varying levels of benefit from hearing aids or cochlear implants, and they are all using sign language either for language support or for full communication. In addition to being deaf, my students are also in a Title 1 school in a Title 1 county. \n\nThis easy to use video camera will help our students to support reading by helping us record translations of the stories, real life items, and sign language interpretations.  The video element will help support reading and language skills in a form that my students can more easily relate to and learn from. \n\nDonations to this project will be extremely beneficial to supporting students with language deficits.  My students will be able to use technology to support learning in a different way and connect with the world they know.  Thank you! "
Kindergarten In Need of Important Materials!,"It takes a special person to donate to a group of children they don't know, especially in these hard economic times, but my students are worth it.

I teach a wonderful group of 4-5 year old Kindergarten students.  They come in wanting and willing to learn new and exciting things each and every day. I work hard to ensure that my students get the most out of the entire school year. \n\nFor the most part, this is the first academic experiences my students have.  That's why it is vitally important to ensure that they keep the excitement and joy for learning throughout the entire school year and take it with them to first grade.  To ensure this happens, there are certain supplies that every classroom needs. \n\nUnfortunately, with past and present budget cuts, supplies are not readily available.  This makes it increasingly difficult to ensure that my students can continue to be productive and excited about learning day after day.  Chart tablets and markers to write out experience charts, sentence strips for activities and bulletin boards, crayons for art and learning, safety tags for field trips and an electric sharpener will allow my students enjoy learning each and every day. \n\nPlease, I know it takes a special person to donate to a group of children they don't know, especially in these hard economic times, but my students are worth it.  They deserve to have the proper supplies to ensure that their long education gets off to the right start. "

As their teacher, it is my duty to provide a wide variety of texts as we begin to learn how to read. \n\nKindergarten students are excited about school - especially about learning to read. I hope to feed their excitement by introducing new types of text, and different reasons for learning. Learning to read non-fiction text is often a struggle for beginning readers, but ""Let's Find Out"" magazine makes it fun. \n\n""Let's Find Out"" is an awesome magazine that keeps students entertained with colorful thematic stories presented at age-appropriate levels. The simple, repetitive text will introduce our students to important early reading skills. The magazines also include posters to use in our classroom. \n\nYour generous donation will help a wonderful group of Kindergarten students read and enjoy non-fiction texts. As a teacher, it is my job to empower students by giving them the tools needed to become successful lifelong learners. With your donation, you are taking part in this wonderful process. "

Our class is a 4th grade general education classroom. \n\nIn an effort to go green our district has cut WAY down on the number of copies that can be made.  This makes it very difficult to accurately judge where students are in the learning process.  With the games requested cover all subject areas so students will be doing less paper pencil activities (going green) and having fun with learning which will increase motivation, and participation.   \n\nThe small group environment provides a safe place for students to try out new ideas and feel free to take risks.  Working in small groups to solve the problems presented in these games allow children to develop their problem solving abilities in a fun way.  By using the cross curricular games requested, students will be able to participate in this type of learning environment. \n\nYour help will make learning fun for my students, thus making it possible for my students to reach their goal of becoming life long learners, and responsible, independent citizens."
Too Close for Comfort,"Have you ever had to crowd around an iPad screen to access information? Students are patient with each other, but patience is just not enough when you want to get an assignment completed. Ideally,...",My students need another iPad to experience technology in the classroom. We have one iPad to service approximately twenty-five students. ,"Have you ever had to crowd around an iPad screen to access information? Students are patient with each other, but patience is just not enough when you want to get an assignment completed. Ideally, all students should have an iPad. Considering my budget, it's a dream . I respectfully request 1 iPad. \n\nMy students attend a K-6 public school in Idaho. They attend intervention to assist them with extra academic support. Their ages range from eight to twelve. These students desperately want to ""catch up"" to their peers, and the approximately twenty-five kids work hard everyday in my class to achieve this goal.  These across grade students are divided into four different sessions by their academic strengths and weaknesses. Literally, all of these children beg to use my personal iPad to access information or use it as an educational tool. I have a schedule for usage because that is the only way I can find a fair avenue to ensure students get exposure to this ideal learning tool. If I had one more iPad to schedule into the day, students could experience this ultimate invention that motivates and engages children more than once a week. There are thousands of applications that will allow students to learn concepts in all areas of our curriculum. Intervention would be even more enriched. \n\nI integrate all areas of our curriculum into reading, writing, speaking, listening and math concepts. For example, if we are studying geometry I will have pairs of students take my iPad and take pictures of angles outdoors where they might see angles in nature or man-made materials.They return and orally record their findings on the iPad, along with their pictures, and present to the class the following day.This process takes a long time for all six in the class to complete, because we only have one iPad.  Many times they are crowded around the iPad to acquire the information they need/want simply because the device is so engaging and concise about the topic. I particularly remember observing them shoulder-to-shoulder watching an animated rap about figurative language. They were crowded, but laughing and grasping the concept far more than by filling out a worksheet. After the viewing they wrote their own very creative rap about metaphors and similes. They were motivated! \n\nEducation is experiencing an exciting shift where we teach depth of knowledge of a subject rather than skim the service of a topic. The new Common Core State Standards have set the bar high for learning. With these high standards a new approach to teaching rich content is critical to engage and motivate students. Technology will be key when addressing these rigorous standards, especially with students who need an extra push. I will use an iPad in my classroom very thoughtfully and responsibly. "

Access to flutes and percussion supplies are in demand in our school music program. Funding is becoming more limited with the current economical environment. \n\nOur school has great kids that love to learn and have fun.  As a Title 1 school, many of our students lack the necessary funds to supply an instrument.  The school provides as many as possible.  Our supply of flutes is very low and adding another would give one more student the opportunity to play in the ensemble.   \n\nBy adding a flute, we will have four flutes for check out.  This will allow one more student a year to choose the flute as their instrument.  The student will develop self-confidence, multitasking ability, setting and reaching goals, self-confidence, and pride.  Percussion supplies will allow us to enrich our music with a broader range of percussive sounds. All percussion items are part of a standard band set-up.   \n\nI believe music is an important part of a well balanced education. I believe every student should be able to participate although they may have financial need.  The more students that have access to music the better for them and our community. "

Many of the students are Second Language Learners with little or no English spoken at home. The majority of our school is on free and reduced lunch. Many of the students do not have technology at home and these readers will be a great exposure to learning through the use of technology. The Tag Readers will be a great way for students to work with their families to increase their English skills. \n \n\nI teach 5-K in a very rural South Carolina community. The school has a 93% Free/Reduced Lunch ratio and is also known as a school in the ""Corridor of Shame"". \nThis school year we have faced drastic budget cuts. There is no money for anything ""extra"".  I really feel that this class would thrive with adequate beginning books and the Tag Reader from Leapfrog. I would use these materials as a center activity that the students could enjoy. \n \n\nThese Tag readers will allow my students to be actively engaged in their reading during center time. Right now, for our listening center, we use computers. By adding the Tag readers, students will be able to find a comfortable spot in which to read. The Tag readers will also be a good example of a reader for my struggling readers. They will be able to work on their reading, phonics, and phonemic awareness in a fun way which I hope will help motivate them to want to become even better readers. \n \n\nIf our classroom were to get these Tag readers, they would help all of my students with their fluency and decoding skills. They will especially help my struggling readers because the more examples of good readers that they hear, the more likely they are to be motivated to try and be a better reader. These Tag readers would be another example of a good reader. They also provide learning in a fun way which is always the best way to learn. \n "

The district uses immersion for Kindergarten as the method for building English proficiency.  Many of the students struggle with phonemic awareness and comprehension.  They also lack the resources to build their literacy at home, and I wish to address that issue with my proposal for donor funds.\n\nBecause of their lack of English language proficiency, the caregivers of my students do not read to them on a daily basis and often have their own difficulty understanding notes and flyers sent home. My proposal is to use the funds to purchase books, audio tapes, cassette players and backpacks for these students to take home on weekends.  They would then be told to listen to the stories with their families, fill in a response form which would be written in English as well as their native language, and then return the resources on Monday.  To further build the literacy component, the students would be asked to share with the class their response form.\n\nListening to a story and reading along with the text is a proven benefit to English language learners.  It builds confidence as the children hear the words pronounced correctly and practiced at home.  The families benefit from spending time together as well as hearing English spoken correctly.\n\nOther benefits of the program include encouraging shared literacy experiences with the families, building vocabulary, listening skills, phonemic awareness, and comprehension as well as building self esteem in beginning readers.  Research has proven that early literacy experiences are essential for future academic achievement."

My students receive instruction in smaller, more structured special education classes due to their reading deficiencies. They want to be able to read like their non-disabled peers but many of them have given up on school and are not engaged in their classwork. I would love to provide them with high interest novels to get them re-invested in their learning and help them grow both as readers and as individuals.   \n\nOrca Soundings are teen fiction for reluctant readers. We will use Orca Soundings in leveled small group literature circles. Students will progress through the levels as they strengthen their reading comprehension and fluency. Our literature circles will be a combination of discussion based activities and comprehension checks, and will make students feel safe in their reading abilities in front of their peers.   \n\nFunding this project will make such a difference in the lives of my students because you will be providing them with novels that they won't want to put down and creating ravenous readers for life!

The students in my class need opportunities to develop letter knowledge while learning to read independently.  \n\nAt the beginning of first grade we review letter and sound correspondence and the students are challenged to begin reading independently. At-risk readers who might be intimidated by other books often find alphabet books appealing.

A good example of this would be when we are learning about animals. We will have live African bullfrogs that we will be observing and recording our observations over time. It would great if the students were able to use a camera to have a visual observation to record as well. They would be able to look at the pictures and see if there was any changes and make further observations about the animals. Along with our animal unit, we go to the zoo. The students would be able to use the cameras to take pictures of the animals they saw and discuss their adaptations with each other.\n\nThe possibilities of the cameras are endless.

They love this music program and the many opportunities that they receive through music education at this school, including choir and instrumental ensemble. We are in need of some instruments, however, and our growing population makes the need more intense. Our students sing beautifully, and are learning to accompany themselves on instruments. The purchase of this glockenspiel will be very important to them, and will reward their diligence with the beauty of a balanced instrumental accompaniment. \n\nStudents learn so much through our work with instrumental ensemble music. They learn ensemble skills, how to listen thoughtfully to themselves and others, how to understand notation, how to listen for balance between the voice and the instrument, how to work cooperatively in a group, how to be sensitive to the quality of music. It is simply a priceless experience and challenges the mind while building emotional depth. \n\nI am most hopeful that this project will be supported because this equipment will be used and appreciated for many years to come, and will be a valued part of our music education program.

I know this will make a huge difference in their lives and we will truly be grateful for any help you can offer us.  \n\nMy activity will consist of reading the chapter books as a class (altogether, popcorn reading, etc) and actually stopping from section to section to monitor reading comprehension. We will have class discussions about the chapter books we are reading and how we connect to the characters. This will help the students understand that once you can relate to the characters in a story you will be able to better understand them. Doing this will improve their reading comprehension and begin creating a true love for reading. I plan to use the Student Packets for the selected readings to help me understand their acquired knowledge of our readings and as an indicator on how I can better service my kids. I recall being introduced to whole class chapter reading in 4th grade and loving it. I was a struggling English Language Learner reader who disliked reading until that moment in my life. If that helped me create a love for reading I know it will definitely work for my kids! \n\nI remember being that struggling reading student in the class. If it weren't for my fourth grade teacher introducing chapter book reading to me I highly doubt I would have become the passionate proficient reader I am today. Mrs.Clark changed my life and inspired me to become a teacher. This is why I need your help. I can't do it alone! Our school is under strict budgetary constraints and this would really help us provide our kids the education they deserve. Thank you for your time. "

The American Academy of Pediatrics calls cyber bullying ""the most common online risk for all teens.""  \n\nBullying is not a new problem. While bullying has long been an issue among teens, the use of computers and smart phones to send rumors or post cruel messages has made it possible for bullying to extend beyond the school yard and reach students in the safety of their own homes. Even though physical injuries may not be present, cyber bullying leaves deep emotional scars on the victim. \n\nCyber bullied students may appear sad, moody, or anxious; may avoid coming to school; withdraw from social activities; experience a drop in grades; or fear using a computer. In extreme cases, online bullying can drive a child or teen to deep depression and even suicide. Since 1983, over 150 teen suicides have been linked, in part, to the pressure of cyber bullying. \n\nI am the media specialist in a rural, Title I K-12 school in Alabama. Many of the discipline problems our teachers and administrators face are a result of something that started on Facebook or Twitter the night before. \n \n\nWe are looking at this severe problem within our school and taking steps to educate our students on this issue. One excellent tool that we would like to utilize is the Teen Cybersmarts Program. Teen Cybersmarts is an interactive eBook program which simulates a real-life Internet experience within the safety of an instructional, guided, and fun platform. The goal of Teen Cybersmarts is to ""create savvy cyber-citizens who don't fear the Internet, but can make informed and sophisticated decisions every time they sign on."" Teen Cybersmarts shows users how to deal with online bullying, including how to respond to or ignore a bully and where to turn for help. To implement this program, we must have an eBook Reader. We are asking you to consider a donation toward an Apple iPad so that we may project our online program onto our whiteboard for whole-class discussion.  \n\nIn an era where so much of our communication exists online, it is easy for teens to feel invulnerable and forget the risks associated with interacting online. Thank you so much for considering our project. In a time where education funding has been on the chopping block, it is only because of generous donors like you that my students have the tools they need to succeed. Donors Choose has made such a difference in my classroom. Thank you for believing in my students as much as I do. "

My intention is to broaden their outlook and allow access to geographical, interactive art and history museums worldwide, and to open their window further to a world that is as exciting as it is dynamic. \n\nI teach college level World Geography, World History, and U.S. History in a small, inner city, historical African American school.  My students are, for the most part, typical inner city children with little experience of the world outside their own neighborhood.  Many are underprivileged and classed as ""at risk"" students.  We serve a student population that is changing rapidly.  Our current student population is approximately 70% African American and 30% Hispanic. Many students are the first in their family that have the opportunity to  attend college. Our students are eager to learn, work hard, and consistently score well on state exams. \n\nAs stated, many of my students have little concept or experience of the world outside their neighborhood.  In allowing them easier access to explore such interactive sites as Google Earth, the Smithsonian, the British Museum, I  forsee an increase in knowledge of our own and other cultures.  Recently, as a class, we accessed the Egyptian Room in the British Museum and the students were fascinated and eager to learn more, but with our limited technology resources we could not explore further.   Tablets would allow our student to really explore the entire world. \n\nGiving students the opportunity to understand their own history and culture and the history and cultures of other lands is important in today's increasingly global society.  In giving students access to technology, it will give them the ability to explore the boundaries of the world  in which we live and make them more rounded and knowleagable students. "
"Lights, Camera, Action!",I am requesting a Sony Digital Camera that will allow me to take digital recordings of my students.  The camera will be used to record small group discussions and as a means of communication to another class in Japan that we will be writing letters to throughout the year.,My students need a digital video camera to grow accustomed to being on camera and develop better communication skills.,"Ever seen yourself on television and thought ""who in the world is THAT person?""  My students need to develop better communication skills and become comfortable with seeing themselves in digital video. \n\nMy students come from a high poverty area, however, they attend a magnet school for the arts.  The arts are a great way for them to learn how to focus their attention and learn bodily control.  They attend a special area for dance, drama, and can sign up for a weekly strings class.  Even in the primary grades, there is a push for stage presence and performance, so what better way to have them adapt to seeing themselves than to use a video camera?  My students are very urban and love watching television shows like Hannah Montana and I-Carly, where they see how technology is used to promote a specific ""look.""  Watching themselves on television will help them develop how they appear to others. \n\nI am requesting a Sony Digital Camera that will allow me to take digital recordings of my students.  I want to use the camera to document their first day of school by conducting short interviews about how they are feeling and what they want to learn in the school year.  The camera will also be used to record small group discussions about a book in which each person is given a specific role to play.  I also want to use the camera as a means of communication to another class in Japan that we will be writing letters to throughout the year.  The equipment I am requesting would allow us to broadcast via Internet.  Lastly, I want to use the camera to record group activities in which my students are presenting a project or idea.  All of these activities will give us instant feedback that we can review for assessment in our communication skills. \n\nAs my young students become aware of their surroundings, they will learn how they appear to others.  Communication is important, whether in a small or large group, and my students need to learn how to take turns and use positive body language.  Are they giving everyone in their group a turn?  Are they speaking too softly or loudly?  Are they making eye contact with each other and paying attention to the leader?  A video camera can help assess in all of these areas. "

Getting a head start in financial literacy may have saved me a lot of interest payments as I navigated my way through adult money matters. \n\nI will be working with a very bright, motivated and curious class in the fall. With their motivation and curiosity naturally comes an independent spirit, and the need to express themselves. Those independent expressions often come at inappropriate times, such as when walking though the hallways, on a fire drill or during quiet, independent work time. Rather than discouraging their self expression, I would like to help them channel it into class appropriate creativity, as well as learn how to self monitor for correct, appropriate behaviors. \n\nI am designing a system for classroom rewards, based on a financial literacy theme. My idea is to ""pay"" the students in ""GOOD"" money for positive behaviors or classroom achievements. Many teachers use stars or stickers to recognize these appropriate behaviors. I will use the color printer to create the ""GOOD"" dollars, which they earn for various behaviors. I will also work with them to create various store posters, such as a shopping list, a price list and leaderboard, to track their savings, wish lists and progress. We will display these on the new corkboard. The items such as stickers, crayons and paints will be our inventory. They will be able to save their money for a larger purchase (such as the glitter pens) or use their money sooner for a smaller purchase (like a single Smencil). They will also be subject to having to pay a fine for repeated inappropriate behavior, whereas they may lose part of their savings. \n\nMost people learn life skills by being immersed in them. I am planning on teaching my students financial literacy and appropriate behaviors by immersing them in it each and everyday. By using a motivating, colorful and interesting technique combining positive behavior reinforcement and taking responsibility for their own actions, I know that they will learn to be good savers, be financially literate and continue to work towards being good school citizens.

We Read Long and Strong Every Day,"The more a child reads, the better he will be at reading. It is that simple, but harder to carry out than you think. Especially for children who come from homes without books. My students need...",My students need 8 sets of leveled books to read during independent reading time.,"The more a child reads, the better he will be at reading. It is that simple, but harder to carry out than you think. Especially for children who come from homes without books. My students need fantastic books, written for beginning readers.  They need over 100 apiece in their first year of school. \n\nThese kindergarten students attend an urban/suburban Title I school in Virginia. They come from 50 countries and speak a dozen languages. Many are eligible for free or reduced lunches and come from homes where reading isn't a common activity. Many of their parents don't speak English; some are illiterate. These five-year-olds often haven't attended preschool and start the year ignorant of the alphabet, or how to write their own name. Yet by the end of kindergarten, they have to know how to read and write, or with every passing year they will fall further behind their peers. I am a literacy teacher. My job is to make sure they know how to read and write by June. One of the ways I do this is to expose them to as many wonderful books as possible so that they will not only know how to read, they will love to read. \n\nImagine a room of 5 year olds sitting or lying on the floor, filling the room with a quiet buzz, whispering words to themselves or each other. Beside each is a box of books they've chosen to read and reread this week. The critical element in this picture is the books, 160 of them at a minimum of 8 per child. Multiply that number and you get the idea how many books are needed to keep these children motivated and learning. Buying high quality books costs more money than kindergarten teachers can be expected to spend. Although we work in a generous school district, the budget does not include books for independent reading. The 8 sets of leveled books I am requesting are full of colorful pictures, fun characters, and great details. They include stories or facts, written in simple language early readers can read independently. Although these books are little, they are expensive. Helping a child become a skillful reader early on is worth every penny. \n\nKindergarten no longer is a time to play dress up or color pictures.  Today's students have to learn to read, write and do math. If they fall behind in kindergarten, they will already be struggling readers in first grade, and probably in the years to come. Help my kindergartners stay on track and feel good about themselves as learners with great books they will love. If we can catch them early, we will have helped them for life. "

Our students have left a colorful and artistically rich culture, and now attend school in an urban setting. Our neighborhood school is not in the safest community; our neighborhood lacks aesthetic vibrancy. \n\nOur students are mostly ESL students. Many come from extreme poverty. Most families fall below the poverty line. Some of our families live with other families. We have one family that rents the dining room of an apartment because that is all they can afford. Despite their life trials, we teach beautiful and happy children. They appreciate everything. Most of them are learning English, while learning the curriculum. They attend a 100 year old school (overcrowded, as well) that lacks many of the modern bells and whistles that you find in today's newly constructed educational facilities.\n\nThe staff goes above and beyond to help our students and their families. We have become seasoned in using resources, such as donorschoose.org, to provide for our students. We spend a great deal of personal time trying to accommodate our families with basic needs, such as food, clothing, coats, etc. Sometimes we forget the simplest things children need: like crayons, art, and creativity. \n\nMy high school-aged son is collecting used and broken crayons, and crayon bits, that would normally be trashed. He bought different molds and plans to melt the crayons to create new crayons for our younger students. He has spent much time collecting, sorting and unwrapping the crayons. Once melted, the old crayons will be poured into molds to give them new life. In addition to fun shaped crayons, my son plans on making kaleidoscope crayons, too. We are requesting pencil cases to hold these crayons so they can be distributed in nice packaging. I also am requesting iron-on transfers so we can make a label for these cases. The crayons will be distributed to Kindergarten students in the school where I teach.\n\nMy son hopes that providing these fun crayons will help feed a hunger in young creative souls. It will provide these children with something fun to do, at playtime, since it is so dangerous outside their homes and our school doors in this community. \n\nThe students will be able to reconnect with some of the cultural vibrancy they left in their native countries. We will share with these students a great lesson in recycling and re-purposing something destined for the trash can.\n\n""What the caterpillar thinks is the end of the world, the butterfly know is only the beginning.""

They love reading about American history from different perspectives that are closely aligned with their own as native born and immigrant children of color. \n\nMy students are from an urban city in California. Their community was economically depressed long before the current economic downturn that is currently facing our country and will likely continue to be economically depressed after the county recovers from the current recession. Over 90% of students at our school receive free or reduced lunch. That being said, my students see our school as a gem in their community and come to school each day as scholars who believe that they are capable of accomplishing anything. We were 1 of 2 schools in our very large district to substantially raise our test scores on 2010-2011 state test. We are not a school community with a lot of economic resources, but we do a lot with what we have. I have made it my mission to bring as many excellent resources and experiences to my students as possible with the goal of making their educational experience as rich as possible. \n\nLast year I had great results with using Zinn's book in combination with other U.S and California history books as the bulk of my reading and social studies programs. My experience using A Young People's History of the United States is that it was an excellent resource. I saw my students forming an understanding of themes in U.S. history that they could not get from a textbook. I also saw real growth in their ability to read, discuss and understand a nonfiction texts. As importantly, several students who previously had no interest in history at all, began to see themselves as historians and to love history. \n\nIf I am unable to get a class set of these books through donations, I will not be able to use this book this year, because we don't have a reliable photocopier at our school.  I would hate for my students to miss out on this valuable resource. Please support me in helping my students become scholars and historians. "

Having a laptop at hand will enable me to bring up pictures and video that helps all students learn subject matter. With a laptop computer I can upload photos and videos of the students. These photos and videos would be used to remind ASD students of things we did in the classroom; by doing so we create episodic memories. Episodic memory is also known as an autobiographical memory. Think about it as a picture of our past strongly anchored by our emotional memories. We use these pictures of our past to adapt the way we do things now. Those with autism don't have the ability to readily pull from their past to help them think about how to do things differently today or to help them remember what the most important part of the memory was supposed to be. Slowly, with these photos, I can teach ASD students to pull from past experiences in order remember what they have learned! \n\nYour donation will have a great impact on my classroom!  My students with Autism and typically developing students will learn academically and socially through your donation of a laptop computer to my classroom.  Through your help my students will also gain important computer skills which they will carry throughout their lives! "

It's just a big concrete jungle out there without balls to play sports and games with. Students are having more problems getting along in the yard because there is nothing to do and the few balls we have really get fought over. \n\nOur students come from a high needs community with a lot of heart. Most speak Chinese or Spanish, and all are learning English. Our school is overcrowded with over 500 students. Our students are wonderful to work with, eager to learn, and want to do the right thing. The lack of playground equipment is causing a problem that can easily be solved. \n\nThe 30 playground balls, 30 basketballs, and 30 soccer balls will allow every classroom at my school to have ownership of each kind of ball. They are color coordinated so it will be easy to see from far away what classroom out on the yard has the green balls (for example.) We can save the 5 extra balls of each kind that we get for the tragic incidents when a ball is lost on the roof or rolls away down the street. This will make the students so much happier!  \n\nYour donation can put an end to the constant fighting among say the over two hundred third graders for the three balls on the yard at recess. Each class will be responsible for keeping track of their color balls. Everyone still has to play together. "

The students are in a dual-immersion program which means they are receiving instruction in Spanish and English to help them become bilingual. I have Hispanic students that are being given the opportunity to learn in their primary language and Caucasian students that are learning Spanish as a second language. I have a total of 24 energetic kindergartners that are passionate about learning. They are at an amazing stage in their academic development because they truly want to learn and want to succeed. \n\nI know that with your help I can take my instruction to another level. Research has shown that without engagement student-learning is minimal. My class has shown a high interest in magnetic letters when I use them during our whole-group lessons. As a class, we are currently sharing a small bin of magnetic letters and are using 6 old cookie pans as our magnetic white boards. Since we only have 6 cookie pans and a small bin of letters I can only allow a small group of students to use them at a time. I would like to do whole-group instruction with the magnetic letters and white boards. My students are in the process of learning letters sounds and are starting to read short words, so these materials can help me scaffold their learning. The magnetic white boards, easel, and magnetic letters that you would provide for my students would assist them in various categories of language arts. \n\nKindergartners have a short attention span and with your help my students would be captivated in their learning! Hands-on learning allows children to retain the material, and in this case letter recognition and letter sounds are a crucial component that needs to be mastered in order for students to be able to read. You would be helping me build a strong literacy foundation for my 24 kindergarten students! "

But like most middle school students, they desperately want to be involved and included with their same-aged peers. They come from many districts within our county and spend their day at SEMS. Our 8 to 11 students engage in a largely functional curriculum focused on preparing them for semi-independent life in the community. \n\nWe are living in a golden era of technology. It's cheap, reliable, and very affordable. The ability to type and spell is giving way to the simple abilities to talk and touch. It's so elemental, so intrinsic, and we need to give our students this kind of resource. Unfortunately, our funding and even our salaries have been frozen so we've been unable to get any new technology for over 7 years. With devices like the iPod Touch our students can communicate with voice, video, and pictures. Those with speech delays can use assistive communication software. Special academic needs can be targeted with literally thousands of educational applications. Touch-based devices are the future for our students and we very much want to get at least 2 for our classroom. This is our start. \n\nOur students have a better chance than ever to participate in their local communities with limited support. Touch-based devices are going to be the key. By talking and touching they can find their way to work and home, talk with friends, take photo reminders, and even communicate with others. Our curriculum is very focused on daily living tasks and several iPod Touches will show our kids that yes, they can do LOTS of things on their own. "

Students are only capable of expanding their minds as far as the resources available allow them.\n\nBringing a classroom set of Bloody Times into our classroom will allow my children to experience what life was like during the Civil War era and the after-shock Lincoln's assassination had on the country. This story brings to life two epic events of the Civil War era: the thrilling chase to apprehend Confederate president Jefferson Davis in the wake of the Lincoln assassination and the momentous  20 -day funeral that took Abraham Lincoln's body home to Springfield. \n \n\nThe importance of this project is two-fold.  It not only shows and tells the story of what happened after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, it also provides closure to the entire saga that my students lived through while reading Chasing Lincoln's Killer.

Our area has sustained significant hardships over the last six years.  Hurricane Katrina ravaged our city, then the BP oil spill reeked havoc on the fishing industry.  Eight-five percent of our students receive a free or reduced lunch and breakfast.  Our great state of Mississippi is experiencing financial difficulties.  Schools are asking their teachers to do more with less funding.  \n\nMany of our parents are experiencing financial hardships and are not able to donate needed classroom supplies.  Many of our teachers are not able to continue to spend significant money, from their own pockets, to buy the supplies they would like their students to have.  Our students have tremendous potential and without the enrichment experiences their full potential may never surface.\n \n\nI want my students to have as many upper level challenging activities as possible. Math, English and Reading are subjects that take priority, due to state testing.  My wish is to foster a love of Science. One way I can begin this challenge is to offer a unit of study on animal organ dissection.  Through hands-on learning each student will have the opportunity to dissect.  The students will learn the components and function of this organ.  Through discovery learning each student will have be the opportunity to be the Science Investigator.   \n\nThis project is very important to my gifted students because there is no better way to learn science than to take part in an investigation.  My students have a extremely high degree of curiosity and incredible desire to want to know how things work, this activity will 100% address their needs. Working with students with high IQ's and numerous learning styles is very challenging for me when creating meaningful lessons.  This lesson will be a winner! "

My students know that the sun comes up and goes down, but have never stopped to observe the east to west pattern. \n\nThe resources that I have requested will introduce my students to objects we see in the sky.  They will observe and record how the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  They will learn that the Earth rotates on an axis and understand that the exact path the sun takes in the sky varies by the season.  My students will outline their own shadows and make connections between the shape of the shadow and the position of the sun.  They will use tools to collect and analyze data about moon phases.  Lastly, they will use all of these hands-on investigations to make logical conclusions about the movements of objects in the sky. \n\nWho wouldn't want to learn about the sun, moon and stars?

I would like to  now use technology to offer more immediate and personal teacher feedback. One of the most effective forms of feedback is the writing conference. But often times the full potential of the conference is not realized for lack of a clear record that the student can refer to during revision. This year I plan to record biweekly conferences on student writing using the app, Explain Everything. It will be like a student's own personal Khan Academy. These conferences will be stored in the students' digital portfolio.  Students can use these recorded conferences and feedback to revise their writing and monitor progress. \n\nPeople don't learn from technology, they learn from each other. I use technology to enhance communication and to free up my time for personalized student interaction. The recorded writing conference will enable the student to focus on the personal conference and the writing itself, leaving the record keeping to the machine. "

A Chromebook would be the ultimate way to access these chemistry educational apps that are critical for teaching important science concepts.  \n\nChromo Domo is exactly what it sounds like - we are in much need of a Chromebook which we will be very thankful for - so domo arigato in advance!   We all have the opportunity to help students learn, let's make it memorable with a Chromebook.  "
"Save the Trees, Go Green With Math--Phase II","My students need hundreds number boards and peg counting boards.

Your generous donations will provide my students the opportunity to practice specific math skills.",My students need 10 hundreds number boards and 5 peg counting boards. ,"Where do I want math to go today with my students? Everywhere!! My students love math and I want to help them have a good foundation by making math fun and a part of everyday life. I also want to educate students about the ways they can reduce paper and save trees. \n\nMy students consist of 99% African American and 1% Hispanic. We are a Title 1, inner- city school located in a low income area. One hundred percent of my students qualify for the free lunch program. My Kindergarten students are naturally playful and eager to learn new things. We live in an information and technology-based society which require students to be able to think critically about complex issues, analyze and adapt to new situations, solve problems of various kinds, and communicate their thinking effectively. Math skills are critical for a child's education. I want to instill a love of math at an early age so that my student will learn to excel in math. \n\nI make most of my materials by hand. Lately, I have been discussing the importance of saving our natural resources and our planet. I make a lot of number charts for various activities in math. In doing so, I use a lot of paper. These activities end up destroyed each year. The materials that I have ordered are made of durable plastic and will last for many years. Numbers and counting, is the beginning of math. The Hundreds Number Board introduce number patterns, sequencing and place value. The Peg Number Board provides tons of hands-on counting practice as students learn to associate numbers and quantities.  No paper or pencils are needed!! This is just one simple step that my class is taking towards ""Going Green"" to help save our trees. Your generous donations will provide my students the opportunity to practice specific math skills.  \n\nI think that this project is important because both activities are hands-on and fun, as well as being, student friendly.  The added double-sided feature make the hundreds board unique. Recessed squares feature numbers printed on the front and a plain grid for patterning and graphing activities on the reverse.  The number peg board will be used to teach number facts, counting, number recognition, beginning addition and subtraction, number relations, sequencing and color recognition. "

I cannot express to you how difficult it is to do that with only an overhead projector. My students take trigonometry/analytical geometry, college algebra & trigonometry as well as advanced algebra, all of which are woven with concepts related to real-life applications. Given to their artistic background, most of my students want to see the connection of math to real-life situations and ask ""Where am I going to use this?"" Without using the right technology, I always find it very difficult to practically answer their legitimate questions albeit I always try my best. Honestly speaking, most students think that math is some giant out there that merely deals with “x’s & y’s”. They do not think that math is real as they didn't see it yet! Please help out! \n\nHaving the LCD projector in my room would mean  a lot to my students and me. I will not only teach or tell the importance or application of math in real-life but I will be able to practically show them using simulations, animations, power-point presentations. We will use the supplementary CDs/videos of the textbooks for our classes, etc. Students will use power-point presentations for their projects/assignments. My utmost goal is to prepare my students for college education and be competitive in the technologically dynamic society we live. I want to make my classroom appealing to students so that students will come with excitement and positive attitude to learn math, appreciate education and be passionate about learning math.

They've planned future traveling plans, designed their dream homes, and have become celebrated community heroes.\n\nThe classroom is a safe haven where dreaming high is encouraged. Nothing is impossible when they dream, write, and share their future plans. They would thrive as enthusiastic learners if they are provided with the memories that will last a lifetime. They are enthusiastic learners because they are provided with the hands-on experiences and activities that at home are simply unattainable. \n\nIn today's classroom, teachers require so much from their students in Language Arts, Math, and Science.

Because of this passive entertainment, they have yet to discover that they can play an active roll in creating a dynamic, creative, and meaningful world for themselves. \n\nFor many years in a row now, I have surprised my students with a black light painting party. They are greeted at the door with wacky, day-glow costumes. When they walk into the dark classroom their jaws drop. As painting instructions are called out they lose themselves in the experience. As the day progresses, more and more murals are created until every surface of the room is completely covered. They drag their friends over during break and lunch to show them what they created. \n\nThis lesson was inspired by the artist Keith Haring who was an incredible activist. He created art for the people and made sure it was accessible to everyone, not just people who pay to go to galleries. Many of his works incorporated children working on large pieces together. His large, childlike, playful pieces have delighted millions. \n\nMy students leave this project full of excitement about getting involved in community projects. They become leaders and organizers.

Though they would love to interact with the new technology.\n\nMy students are from a low-income area in California, and are largely unmotivated towards school in general. Our school has a focus on incorporating technology into the classroom and the lessons, but lacks the budget with which to do so. The students come from families whose incomes rarely allow for newer technologies in the students' home lives, so there is a bit of a predicament in meeting the school's focus.  \n\nClassically, mathematics is the class in which students have the least motivation. A skilled teacher will incorporate many hands-on, interactive activities, but there are some days where a lecture simply cannot be avoided. The best way to motivate the students is to make the lectures hands-on, as well. As I already have an interactive whiteboard set up, having a way for the students to interact with it will get them excited for the class, if for no other reason than getting to use the cool technology. Passing the tablet around the room gives one student control of the board at a time, and can be a great motivator for getting them to participate in the lesson. \n\nMany students have no problem contributing, but hate going up to the board. These are often my best and brightest students. If their energy could be focused into showing the class how to do a problem, the struggling students would learn a lot more from their peers, and from not having to worry about the peers who do volunteer standing in the way of what they write.

Pennies for Paper,In order to have my students gain a stronger grasp and deeper understanding of the complexities of the subjects that we are studying I need more paper to be able to give my students clear guided notes.,My students need 6 cases of white copy paper.,"Help!

My school serves a high-need community and a primarily African-American population. \n\nMy students have a love of and curiosity for science that cannot be adequately satisfied without the right materials. \n\nFor all of my students, science is an interesting, yet intimidating, subject where they feel they have very little success. One of my largest obstacles in teaching science has been the lack of material resources available to make abstract ideas tangible to my students; simply telling students the information does not help them learn. \n\nIn order to have my students gain a stronger grasp and deeper understanding of the complexities of the subjects that we are studying, including Astronomy in 6th Grade, Cells in 7th Grade, and Matter in 8th Grade, I need more paper to be able to give my students clear guided notes. Since the middle years are the formative years of learning, I want my students not only to have the skills and knowledge needed to master science material, but also have the note-taking skills that they will need for success in high school and college. \n\nWith the few resources and supplies that my school has, all teachers are given the same amount of paper at the beginning of the year. However, I teach a total of 180 students compared to the 30 to 70 students that most teachers instruct. Therefore, I have already exhausted my stack of paper only one month into the school year, and I am no longer able to help my students organize their ideas. I want to give my students the skills they need to be masters of their own education! \n\nWith your help and support, my students will be able to make sense of complex science material and be prepared for success in their future educations."

He provides a fascinating glimpse into the car culture of Southern California that created the fast food craze, but drives home the connection between fast food and obesity. He also takes on social issues by examining the working conditions of suppliers, and of the teenagers who provide minimum-wage fast food labor.\n\nOur school's poverty rate is high, and nearly all children receive free meals.

These girls come from low income areas where the statistics of their graduating high school are not high. Our goal is to break the cycle of poverty in these areas by providing strong education and helping these girls move onto college.  My students came to me with a concern about all the paper we use in our classrooms.  They developed the idea of collecting rubbish paper from their teachers, shredding it, and throwing it all away separately in clear bags for recycling.  We are grateful that ABC Family is offering a funding opportunity. \n\nThe paper shredder will be used to break down recyclable paper which is used in abundance in our classrooms.  Clear plastic bags will be used to collect recycling from participating homerooms so it can be disposed of properly.

School supplies like pencils and writing pads will be used to start our Recycling Letter Writing Campaign. \n\nOur students come from poverty-stricken areas where the statistics of a girl graduating from high school are very low.

One of our school-wide initiatives is that all students must read at least 35 books during the school year.\n\nRecently during parent-teacher conferences, many parents asked if their children could get books and recommendations from my classroom library. Unfortunately, our school does not have a library at all and my classroom library consists only of borrowed books from another ESOL teacher and one complete set of the Chronicles of Narnia (my own first indulgence in building it further). I need help to support a classroom library with books appropriate for 1st through 8th grade. I have focused my proposals on Newberry and Caldecott medal winners, as they represent distinguished contributions to children's literature and children's picture books by American authors. \n\nI will do my best to see that students have worn the pages of each book by the end of the school year, by supporting the 35 Books Campaign through a weekly reading hour after school and a school-wide Readathon in the spring. These books will be used by my 28 ESOL students in the weekly reading hour, and by the entire school during the Readathon. In both situations, students will be able to choose from these engaging books and read at their own pace and level. \n\nAs I read through the list of Newberry and Caldecott Medal books, I recognize many of the names and remember them from my youth. These books are identified because they are the most engaging and memorable, exactly what my English language learners need to not only complete 35 books during this school year, but to develop a lifelong appreciation of reading.\n\nThis proposal contains about a fifth of the Newberry and Caldecott Medal winners including Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze by Elizabeth Lewis, Shen of the Sea by Arthur Bowie Chrisman, The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle by Hugh Lofting, and Make Way for Ducklings by Robert McCloskey.\n\nThank you for supporting my students by giving them access to engaging literature."

I am a fifth and sixth grade bilingual teacher at I.S. 125 in the Bronx. Approximately 95% of the students in my school qualify for reduced or free lunch.  100% of my students receive free lunch. My class this year will be comprised of about 28 English language learning/bilingual students most of whose families have immigrated to the United States in search of a better life for their families.  Because of their familial and economic circumstances and the efforts their families have made to be in this country, my students are constantly eager to learn and advance in their studies.  Unfortunately the lack of special attention and tools for learning available to my students often makes it difficult to take full advantage of my students' drive and perseverance. \n\nI am incredibly dedicated and passionate about my work and constantly search above and beyond for tools and resources so that my students have an equal opportunity to an excellent education and an excellent future. Last year, I encountered several challenges as a first year bilingual teacher because of the severe lack of resources available to my students as native Spanish speakers.  Despite these conditions, my students achieved more than anyone could've imagined and felt proud of what they had proven to themselves.  This year, I want to make sure my students have ALL they need to be academically successful both by their own measurement and by the measurement of State and local education.  I do not want my students to be denied their right to an excellent and equal education.\n\nAs we all know, reading is perhaps the most important component of any learners life.  Specifically, in the lives of my bilingual students, reading is more than just a part of school - it means having true exposure to the world of reading for the first time, learning a new language, developing and sustaining a first language and often - learning how to read all together.  Many of my students have low reading skills (if any at all) due to the hardships and life experiences that kept them away from academia in their home countries. Learning to read for my students means more than just taking a standardized test.  It means learning why reading is important, its significant role in learning a second language and the beauty of sustaining and developing their first.  \n\nThis summer I took Lucy Calkins' ""The Art of Teaching Reading"" as a Columbia University Teacher's College graduate student. In this course I was taught and trained the principals of one of the top and internationally renowned reading and writing projects in the field.  This proposal is one of nine all linked to implementing Lucy Calkins' Reading Workshop in my classroom next year (and for years to come in my work with bilingual students). The fundamental thought of this program is to teach students HOW to read, WHY to read and to create life-long learners and readers.  Reader's workshop takes place every day for a minimum of 50- 70 minutes of the day and utilizes coursework across all subject areas to boost and build the students as readers.  In this program, the teacher is not the ""lecturer"" in front of the classroom but a coach that guides the team and each individual player towards their best.  I provide the readers with the tools to think critically, read critically and assess critically all while enjoying reading. In order to do this students need to have access to a large quantity (at least 15 books per student) and a wide array (all genres) of literature.  This proposal specifically requests all sorts of author study books (including E.B. White, Paula Fox, Lois Lowry, and Cynthia Voight) in Spanish. It is one of 9 other proposals that together can make this project a reality in my classroom.  Other proposals linked to this same project request donations of books in other genres (and also break up the total cost into parts). \n\nUnfortunately, without Donorschoose and people like you, this project would be virtually impossible. Thank you so much for helping me help my students live up to their dreams. Funding this proposal will be an important start to providing my students with an equal chance in education and in life. \n\nThe cost of the books, ranging from E.B. White's ""Las telaranas de Carlota"" to Lowis Lowry's ""Anastasio Tiene Problemas"", is $332, including shipping and disposable camera. "

Our PYP Programme emphasizes lifelong learning and focuses our inquiries into various themes like: Sharing the Planet, Who We Are in Place & Time, How We Express Ourselves, etc. We strive to create compassionate, contributing global citizens!   We have a vibrant ""specials"" program including regular art, music, gym, and Spanish. \n\nWe need the essentials to keep our teachers in supplies like paper, printer toner, staples, and tape.  As an urban turn around school, our teachers have been working hard to build a fantastic International Baccalaureate program for the last 5 years. Our efforts are working: Student achievement is up. And, enrollment is up by more than 100 students with a waiting list in several grades.\n\nOur teachers need the basic supplies to keeping doing what they are doing well.  We produce materials and give out homework, among other things!  In addition to IB, we have implemented a cutting edge, rigorous Response to Intervention (RTI) program through which the teachers track, analyze, plan, and hold themselves and their students accountable for improvement and achievement.  All of this great work requires paper, toner, staples, and tape. \n\nWe are at a critical moment in our school's redevelopment: keep us going in the right direction with basic teacher tools including paper, toner and staples.  Our teachers are already teaching creatively and effectively using what limited resources they have.  They can do even more with these essentials! "

Indeed, it begins in...",My students need 5 copies each of 5 leveled nonfiction books for daily reading instruction.,"College professors and high school teachers observe that students consistently have trouble reading nonfiction texts. The solution can be found in elementary school. Indeed, it begins in kindergarten. \n\nI teach kindergarten and first grade (I stay with the students for two years) at an urban elementary school. About 90% of the students are low-income, and 90% are English language learners. Most have not been to preschool, so I am their first exposure to formal education. \n\nMy students are ravenous readers. I meet with each student several times a week for small group reading instruction. In each small group meeting, students learn to read real books, not textbooks, and keep a book in their personal collection to practice over the next few weeks.\n \nThe problem is that nearly all of the books in my classroom library are fiction. My students get very little practice reading and discussing nonfiction. Because of lack of practice, my students have difficulty anticipating what they will learn, distinguishing between main ideas and supporting details, and summarizing what they have read. Thinking through nonfiction text isn't harder than fiction, simply different.\n \nThe nonfiction book sets requested will allow my students ample practice to read and discuss nonfiction texts. They will be increasing their science content knowledge while learning how to approach, read, and discuss nonfiction. \n\nLearning how to read and discuss nonfiction isn't a mystery. It takes practice. Students need to start reading nonfiction early on and read it often. This is also how one learns to enjoy reading nonfiction and conducting research. Creating the next generation of scientists starts with nonfiction books in kindergarten. "

When I do buy or make a new center for them, they wear it out.  I think that I must inspire exploration, because the learning that happens during that exploration far exceeds anything that I could do as a teacher.\n\nWhile exploring with manipulatives my students learn social reuldes and interactions, spacial learning, either science or social studies principals, and vocabulary skills that pay off in future lessons\n\nWhen I was single I was able to do anything that I wanted for my class.

Our school is made up of mostly minority students who are receive free and reduced based on family income.  \n\nI cannot explain how difficult it is to be in a classroom without a pencil sharpener that does not work properly.  In first grade, students are still learning to hold pencils and write correctly. We go through a lot of pencils! When we don't have more pencils readily available, we must stop to sharpen pencils on a sharpener that often does not work properly and causes a huge and unnecessary distraction. \n\nWe need these basic supplies! It's very difficult to teach or learn in a classroom without supplies such as paper and pencils. These supplies get used in every subject every day by every student.

They will ride on a bus for an hour and a half (starting at 8am on a Saturday) to see over 20 famous teen authors speak. \n\nThe Festival is an amazing atmosphere in which authors are treated like Rock Stars and literacy is celebrated.

The authors that will be attending the Festival are nationally recognized and award winning authors. As such, it is difficult to keep their books on our library shelves. I want my Book Club members to be able to read many of the books from the amazing authors they are going to meet - including Laurie Halse Anderson, Ellen Hopkins, Barry Lyga and Terry Trueman.\n\nOur library budget is small and we must buy non-fiction materials that support our curriculum so purchasing multiple copies of these popular fiction titles is not feasible. \n\nI have made a wish list of about 35 books. Fulfilling this request will put great and engaging literature into the hands of deserving students.\n\nMy students put time and effort into raising the bus money for this trip. We make matching t-shirts advertising our group around school. They are are so excited to meet authors that they show up to school on a Saturday to ride a bus for what seems like an eternity to meet these amazing authors.\n\nPlease help make their experience more special by giving them all the opportunity to read as many of the books as they can get their hands on. Your donation will be the difference between them being able to read a book or not. It will mean the world to them and they mean so much to me. \n \nThank You!\n\n\n"

","Can you imagine searching through dozens of books trying to find one on your level?  My students struggle with this on a daily basis.  The leveled reading bins will help them to find books on their level quicker and easier.  The listening center will allow them to listen to their books. \n\nMy students are eager to learn, but due to circumstances beyond their control, they have various struggles.  The students in my class all have some sort of special need.  Learning doesn't come easily to them.  They strive to do their best in each and every situation they encounter.  At any given time, I have students in my room ranging from kindergarten to fifth grade. \n\nWith the new listening center and headphones, my students will be able to reap the benefits of hearing their stories read aloud.  This will help increase their vocabulary and comprehension skills, in turn making them better readers overall.  The leveled book bins and storage unit will make it easier to help them find books on their reading level, giving them more time to enjoy their selections. \n\nThis project is important for my students so that they can become better readers.  With the varied reading levels of my students, these items will provide more opportunities for each of them to increase their individual reading skills. "

By reading work that reflects their culture such as Villasenor's 'Rain of Gold' and Sonia Nazario's, 'Enrique's Journey, this will inspire them to seek out information about their own families, and find pride in their culture.\n\nMy students are amazing, and regardless of their situations at home and in life, they continue to strive. \n\nI teach in an inner-city school that is known for its overcrowding, lack of resources, gangs, drugs, and high teen pregnancies here in California. \n\nThe students I have in my English class are amazed by the characters we discover in class.  We are starting with Lennie and George from Of Mice and Men, and ""Romeo and Juliet"". They see the universal themes  in these works. What would be idea is for them to read Victor Villasenor's historical nonfiction text, 'Rain of Gold'. \n\nI feel my students would be able to relate to this book because the author tells of his family's ancestry through pride and honor, their struggle, and what it meant to come to this country and make a life for oneself through hard work and determination. It's a true story and I feel my students would benefit from reading a text where the main characters are like them, Latino. \n\nI have encountered and developed units around these texts which include study questions, journaling, literature circles, an essay, and a family project which includes interviews of 2 family members and their journeys (or family's journey) to this country, and a family tree or artistic creating of the journey.\n\nI have these resources. Now I just need the 25 copies of the two texts as class sets so I can have my current and future students read the text.\n\nI feel that this activity will instill family and cultural pride in my students, something that many are lacking because they are unaware of the importance of struggle. In addition, I feel this will help inspire my students to move forward beyond their own expectations of themselves. \n\nOf course my students will improve their reading, analytical and writing skills - but they will also gain historical information about California, and the United States. \n\nAgain, my students love reading Of Mice and Men, but they also need characters who reflect their own struggles, their own cultural reflections. By getting these 25 copies of 'Rain of Gold' and 'Enrique's Journey' my students will be able to improve their academic skills and cultural literacy. "

Everyone loves to listen to a great story! My students are English language learners, in grades k-5, who could greatly benefit from having a listening center where they could listen to books being read to them. \n\nMy school is a high-poverty, urban k-5 elementary school where 50% of the population are English Language Learners. There are more than 20 different languages represented among our students! I work with students in kindergarten through fifth grade, helping them to access the core curriculum of their grade. \n\nHaving a variety of books on CD will help create listening centers for students who are learning English.  By hearing books in English read to them, students are able to hear the natural cadence of the English language. Students will also be able to follow along with the book, while listening, allowing them to hear correct pronunciation of the written text and a correct model of the English language.  This helps to take the decoding out of reading, allowing students to focus on comprehension, which is one of the most difficult aspects of reading for an English language learner. \n\nPlease consider helping my students have this exposure to the English language while listening to wonderful literature!  Having a listening center is important because it gives ELL's access to great books, and engages them in the literacy process.  Students can listen to the books over and over, helping to inspire a lifelong love of reading! "

Bullying and making fun of others is becoming common place.  It must stop! We cannot ignore and turn a deaf ear to our youth! \n\nMy elementary is no different than any other elementary school. Our youth come from one and two parent homes.  There are those that live with grandparents and others that are homeless. Economically, we are spread across the board. We are not very diverse, but that means that when someone is ethnically or financially different the students are not as tolerant as they could be to each other. Education is key. \n\nA variety of books as resource materials have been requested to be used to guide us on our quest. The school district has purchased a large screen mounted television for our school.  I also requested a digital camera as we will be showcasing student work giving students a pat on the back, build self-esteem, teach problem-solving and coping skills. The television has been placed in a position that all students in the building will receive these lessons, not just the Kindergarten that is spearheading this gift to the school. \n\nBudget cuts across the nation cause schools to become creative in their approach to teaching character education.  Programs that address bullying and self-esteem have been eliminated along with the staff that provided these lessons. Help us be committed to aid students to become good citizens. "

Seventy percent our our students receive free/reduced lunch. The school is also a magnet school for orthopedically impaired elementary age children.  The O.I. program is a full inclusion program offering the entire school community a tremendous learning opportunity. \n\nThe overall goal of Headlands Institute's program is to inspire students with passion for nature and promote the desire to care for the environment. In addition, students make connections to the real world from the learning that took place in the classroom. As part of our preparation for the trip my partner and I connect the following activities to our trip throughout the year: writing, science, research, literature, technology, and PE. \n\nEach year former students return to visit. Everyone of them ask if we still go to Headlands Institute. They share their memories of the trip as if it happened yesterday. Many remember their environmental pledges they made before returning home. I would hate for this to be the year we have to respond, ""No, we couldn't go."" "

Of the ten learning centers in my classroom, the dramatic play center--most recently converted from a housekeeping area to a pizza parlor--is by far, the most popular center of choice.    \n\n    Dramatic play links creative imagination with language usage.  Five- and six-year-olds need lots of practice with verbal expression, and the dramatic play center allows for that to take place.  For five years I have taught kindergarten, using worn-out, mismatched, hand-me-down pieces of dramatic play furniture.  I have replaced or repaired broken parts, but the equipment has been used beyond its ""lifespan"" now.  We are now experiencing broken parts that are not possible to repair.  In our current economic times, my school system has put a freeze on the budget; and ordering replacements for these broken items does not look promising for next year either. \n\n   If our pizza parlor had a new refrigerator, stove and cupboard, the children would pretend to make and serve pizza in a safe and sturdy center.  They are learning to follow the pizza recipe, take orders from the phone and at the table, serve the pizza, use a cash register and work with money.

They are experts of gardening, identifying native plants and animals, composting, re-using, sharing clothing and book swaps. \n\nToday, students are experiencing obstacles of hunger, stress, and anxiety outside of school and bring their home lives with them into the classroom every day. Each day, my students enter the classroom carrying the weight of their lives (and, because of our close community, their families, friends, neighbors, etc.) on their backs. I am requesting simple yet effective equipment that students can use for sensory breaks! Physical movement or sensory stimulation can increase blood-flow and breath rate for a student who is ""stuck"" and unable to focus on schoolwork. With careful and intentional teaching, I believe students in my classroom will not only be able to identify feelings of stress and anxiety but also identify strategies to release some of these difficult feelings. Tools such as balls, exercise dice, and tactile fidgets are important in this endeavor. \n\nImagine the stress in our own adult lives. Children are sponges and not only have their own stressors, but unknowingly absorb the feelings and emotions of those around them. Imagine teaching students at a young age how to not only recognize these feelings and their impact on learning but to learn strategies with which to decrease their strength and increase their emotional and physical well-being. These strategies will help our students for their entire life. "

What my classroom is lacking in the most is test preparation materials that teach my students the skills they need to master our state mandated Criterion Referenced Tests. Students face so many pressures in today's classroom that were irrelevant when I was in elementary school. The pressure to pass the state tests is just one of the many things they struggle with when they reach the intermediate grades. The group of students that I have coming in this fall did very poorly on the tests in the 2008-2009 school year. Over half of them were unable to pass the Math or Language Arts test. \n\nWith so many student's struggling to pass these tests, this tells me that I need to focus on test taking skills and reinforce Math and Language Art skills through daily standards based practice review. This is why this proposal is asking for a resources that will teach students the strategies they need to be successful test takers, and reinforce their learning through daily practice. \n\nThe Daily Language and Daily Math Centers that are requested will be used for weekly math and language arts skills reinforcement. These centers will help me as a teacher evaluate what skills the students are struggling with so I can see what areas I need to provide further instruction. The Test Prep Language Rings and Test-Taking Strategies Activity Center will provide my students with practice on the question formats they can expect to see when taking the state tests. When students are familiar with the question formats on state and national tests, they become confident and can avoid the test anxiety I have seen some of my students display in the past. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read my proposal. It is truly inspirational that donors like you are willing to give to students in need throughout the country. Your donation will make it possible for my students to not only acquire the skills they need to pass the mandated state tests, but to also acquire confidence in their own testing abilities as we practice our test taking skills with these materials throughout the school year.

Utilizing technology to help them will help all achieve higher reading levels. \n\nHow would you feel if you were told the class was going to read but you didn't know how to read well enough to participate? What if you were lacking experience with technology because your parents, guardians, group home, etc. couldn't provide them? \n\nMy students are bright children who need to be given the opportunity to reach their potential. Our school is a Title I school. This means that an overwhelming amount of our students are on free and reduced price lunch. These children want to learn and be successful in their classes, however many of them are faced with the inability to read on grade level as they have not had the support at home that their wealthier peers have had as a result of having to help raise their siblings while their parents are working or they have reading disabilities which hinder their learning. \nThey deserve to utilize 21st century learning materials in the classroom in order to allow them to function in the world at large which utilizes these materials daily. \n\nWhen you enter my classroom you will see students working in literacy centers. The Netbooks will be utilized in a center to enable children to download books, have books read aloud to them, and practice on-line tests (which are the way of the future).\n\nAnother center will utilize Weekly Reader in order to maximize reading potential by providing current events as well as a variety of reading genres and skills. These readers will also provide vocabulary growth. They can be used with Netbooks as well. I have requested 20 Weekly Readers so they can be divided among 4 classrooms and used in centers.\n\nFinally, the camera will allow students to create digital projects. Technology is the reality of the world today and children need to be prepared to function within that realm. \n\nThis project will reach several hundred students per week for several years to come. Your donation will allow these children the opportunity to be educated in the area of reading while being immersed in the technology of the 21st Century. "

They are a group of 3 and 4 year olds, just starting off on their educational adventures! We are located in an underprivileged neighborhood about ten minutes outside of a large California city. Our program is specifically for low income students and we are designed to involve our families in their children's education as well. My students are very diverse - this year we have six different languages spoken by our students and their families.These amazing kids are ready to soak up all kinds of information and use any means we can give them to explore their world and the greater world around them. \n\nAs we are finding out, the possibilities for learning provided by a tablet, such as an Apple iPad, are endless. From things as simple as storing and being able to access all of our music at our fingertips, to more complex ideas such as translating lessons into a variety of languages, the possibilities are so exciting! Allowing the children to explore this technology will prepare them for the future, where many of them will be using tablets for everyday lessons. Introducing it at this young age will get my students comfortable with the technology and able to navigate it easily. We are excited about the possibilities for the iPad to help streamline assessments as well, freeing up more time for teachers to use in hands on lessons with the students. My students need an iPad with a protective case and a stereo to use for choosing their own music, exploring educational websites and interactive curriculum connections.\n\nIn our technological world, early exposure to the newest technology is key for our students. These children are growing up with technology all around them which they often have no access to. Our new iPad, with all its accessories, will open up new possibilities for your preschoolers!

It is an exciting time for most kids, but many families can't afford to make this a reality for their kids.  \n\nMy students are from the rural south western part of Idaho. Many are financially challenged and are part of families that are doing their best to meet the needs of everyday life.

Students are sent back to class without their necessary supplies and teachers are expected to fill the void.  \n\nI am requesting mechanical pencils, wooden pencils, fine tip and wide tip markers, colored pencils, and composition notebooks. Having brand new school supplies that can be their own is a great boost to children in need. They will be able to take ownership in their new supplies and not be dependent on their neighbors for needed items. Students will have everything that they need to successfully begin the new school year, and engage fully in their education. These supplies will allow them to focus on their learning. \nHaving schools supplies at the beginning of the year will give my students the level playing field that they deserve to start off the year on the right track.

Most of my students have never had these experiences growing up, the experience of the falling in love with the beauty of literature.  \n\nI have students who are so full of life, with questions and so many big dreams they want to fulfill. Unfortunately,  many of my students come from homes in which they are not given the opportunity to dream big because they are worried about whether or not they are going to have dinner that night. For me, as a language arts teacher, the hardest part to swallow is that their families can't afford to buy their child a book, or they have never had the time to read to their child before they go to sleep because they are working their third job of the day. 85 percent of the students at my school qualify for free and reduced lunch. 80 percent of my students read below grade level because of the lack of access to quality reading instruction, as they have been passed from grade to grade. Our school does not have a working library where students have the opportunity to check out books of their choosing and many of my students have never stepped foot into a public library.  \n\nWhen my students walk into my classroom, one of the first things they see is the famous quote said by Gandhi, ""You must be the change you wish to see in the world."" My students have such a desire to impact the world and the best way to learn about this great big world, is reading about all it has to offer; whether it is fighting the battle against good vs. evil, or figuring out what kind of person you are when faced with adversity. By donating to this project, you will help create a classroom library, to support a Reader's Workshop. Reader's Workshop is a research-proved effective model to help struggling readers and grow able readers. It is designed around students choosing books on their own, reading independently, sharing with their peers, and learning what strategies good readers use to make meaning of text. Through the power of choice through the Workshop model, students will have the opportunity to not only fall in love with reading, but become the people they hope to be.   \n\n""Books are humanity in print."" This quote explains the power that literature can have on an individual life. By choosing this project, you are not just buying books off of a list, you are giving students who come from less than ideal situations the ability to dream and fall in love with one of the few things that will give them hope and sustain their future. These books will allow students to create the kind of person they want to be and become apart of the world in which they live. THANK YOU!! "

A listening center promotes reading fluently! \n\nMy students live in an urban area, and are from varying ethnic backgrounds. Some live in the neighborhood and others are bused in from surrounding areas. The school is quite large, and with 33 students in my class, students are always craving space for reading.  They love being at school, and especially love hearing books read to them! \n\nHaving a listening center in my classroom would make a world of difference to my students.  The listening center, headphones, books on disc, and storage system for multiple copies of books would make building fluency a much less daunting task.  The students will be able to hear a model of fluent reading style, paying special attention to expression and how to pause for punctuation.  They will follow along with their own copy of the book in a small group setting, which is ideal for learning! \n\nDonating to our classroom project would be highly impactful for my students. The ability to listen to a book on disc, and follow along in the text on their own reinforces how one should read: with fluency, expression and proper pauses for punctuation.  Not only would donating to our classroom help students gain a listening center, but it would also build a love for literature. There's nothing quite like listening to a story! "

Graphic novels encompass many genres, both fiction and nonfiction, fantasy and realism, with a variety of styles of storytelling and art.  \n\nThe graphic format engages reluctant readers because it gives them more support than the words on the page. The art and illustrations appeals to visual learners and provide a context that can help English language learners glean meaning from the text.\n\nAdding these graphic novels to our library's collection will mean high-interest materials will be available to show students that reading doesn't have to be boring or too difficult to be enjoyable. \n \n\nThe most valuable thing I can teach a child is to love reading.  So many of our children struggle to read or don't read at all.  I have seen these same students spend hours poring over the details of graphic novels, absorbed in the details and discussing it with their friends.  \n\nTeens love graphic novels, and graphic novels promote language and literacy among students who need the most support. Most importantly, graphic novels are FUN to read! "

As we study immigration they will be researching the first person to come to America in their family; as we discuss war and conflict they search and discuss how war may have impacted family members; migration helps them see how family members have traveled across the state or country.  Creating this project has become very expensive; the scrapbook, the paper, pens, stickers (while not required) have become very important to the students and their desire to make it aesthetically pleasing.  The cost is great and so I hope to collect enough supplies so each and every student has the resources necessary to create a meaningful project. \n\nEvery student should know something about where they come from; they should understand the family that came before them and how they connect to the unique story of America.

I am lucky enough to teacher three different classes: 1) Government/Economics 2) AP Government 3) Popular Culture.

I have been teaching in the same school for the past six years.\n\nStudents always feel that art is simply drawing and painting, and they are now coming around to realize that art is much more than that.  It includes pottery, sculpture, and architecture.  They can see all of this, and I can share these opportunities with them from within the classroom. \n\nThe one facet of art that I am not able to share with them is photography.  Photography is one of the most recognized forms of expression, yet is the most costly.\n\nPhoto journalism allows the students to express themselves without using words; they have the opportunity to convey many messages and ideas through the images that they choose.  The two digital cameras in the classroom alone does not allow this to be a successful lesson. \n\nI would gear this project towards my 53 fourth grade students. They have the mental and asthetic capacity and the skills to accomplish this task and will have a meaningful experience in doing so.  The DC Public Schools Standards of teaching and learning suggest that photography be a part of the fourth grade curriculum, and in years past we have explored various magazines and newspapers and discussed the techniques that it takes to make “good” photography, one that contains artistic merit and substance.   \n\nBut to be a real photographer, just as it takes to be a real artist, one must be able to “do.""  I want my students to be able to “do.”\n\nFor this experience, I am requesting disposable cameras for each of the students and the necessary funds to have the pictures developed.  I want them to express their feelings, emotions, and mindset in their lives outside of school.  The students would take a subject with which they are both familiar and comfortable and allow the images to tell a story.  \n\nBefore going out on their own, I'd review the basics of photography and take them to a local museum/gallery to see a photography exhibition so they'll be able to see more examples that they may choose to use on their own. In addition to the cameras, I am also seeking funding for the cost of metro transportation for my students to and from the Smithsonian.\n\nThank-you for your consideration!"

For students that suffer from learning problems and low self-esteem, being able to grasp a new concept is a major accomplishment. It is my job to present the new information in a way the children can grasp it. iPad apps allow me to enhance a lesson by bringing in a new view, making the idea come to life. Beyond the apps, is the iPad itself. Just the sight of it is instant motivation. Motivation is the key for these children. If they are willing to try, then they are willing to learn and anything that betters their understanding of the material presented is a blessing to have in my classroom.\n\nBy adding an iPad to my classroom, I will be adding another reason to try. The iPad seems to make trying something they fear a bit friendlier. The format and presentations presented make them more eager to try and master a difficult task. For my kids, an iPad also brings in another way to present an idea or lesson, I feel that it will motivate my students to learn and enhance my lessons."

They have made such a big growth this year in first grade. They have done an excellent job in the transition from kindergarten to first grade. Along with the help of their parents we will succeed this year. \n\nMy students are in first grade and they are constantly being challenged by the high standards that our school has on us. Getting active is also very important to myself and their physical education teacher. The speaker will help them to stay active by hearing and moving to our core value songs. They can also stay active by doing physical education in class. I am excited if our projects get funded  because sound will definitely motivate them to move. Our commercial electric sharpener will help us eliminate waisting class time sharpening our class pencils. \n\nMy students will use the speaker to be able to better hear when ever I project something from my lap top onto my LCD projector. The speaker will also be used during Physical education to get the students active.  The commercial sharpener will be used to quickly sharpen our pencils during class time. \n\nParents if you are able to donate it will really help our class to be able to properly hear anything that I project from My lap top onto my LCD projector. Their Physical education takes place in class from time to time and it will help them to stay active. The commercial electrical pencil will eliminate students waisting time while sharpening pencil in our old electric pencil sharpeners. Students will not be waisting  any more valuable class time dealing with their unsharpened  pencils.Thank you

They are very sweet and inquisitive boys.  They love school and learning new things.  Autism is a neurological disorder that causes people's brains to function differently.  This often causes a lack of social understanding, as well as a lack of organization.  My students need to learn to work independently in order to function in ""the real world"".  I need materials to help teach them how to work independently and stay organized in the classroom. \n\nI am asking for a chart for students to turn in their work in at, ""unfinished"" folders separated into different classes to store papers that still need to be worked on,and magnetic hooks to store their vocabulary cards on for independent practice.  These materials will help me set up our classroom in a way that encourages independent behaviors.  We currently do not have any of the necessary materials to put those independent procedures in place.  Through these materials, they will learn to be responsible, hard working adults. \n\nPlease help my students learn to organize their materials and work independently so that they can be successful both in school and in life.  Your donations will provide the perfect setting for them to learn these vital skills that will impact them for the rest of their life. "
Human Digestive System Model,"I have created (and taught) an anatomy class where our compelling topic is the digestive system. We go in depth on this topic, and at the end of the trimester we spend two weeks dissecting a fetal pig. If I had a human digestive system model, I would have the visual needed to compare and contrast the human digestive system to the pigs. Being that the model is life size, they would also see the approximate sizes of the various organs.  ",My students need 1 human model.,"Approximately 80% of our students would be high school dropouts if it wasn't for this high school.\nI teach at an Expeditionary Learning, alternative public high school for at risk youth of the county. The school has approximately 100 students at two campuses. I travel between the campuses every other day. I am the only science teacher so I teach every subject and every grade. There are about 10-13 students in each of my classes. Many of my students bring their home life to school so I feel as though I am more than a teacher. Sometimes they need mentoring and a healthy environment more than my teaching. \n\nBeing an Expeditionary Learning school, I create my curriculum around compelling topics to meet the standards of the county and state. I have created (and taught) an anatomy class where our compelling topic is the digestive system. We go in depth on this topic, and at the end of the trimester we spend two weeks dissecting a fetal pig. I found that it was difficult to compare and contrast the pig's digestive system with a humans digestive system. The students really enjoyed the hands on involvement of the dissection and several have thought about going into the medical field after this class.\n\nIf I had a human digestive system model, I would have the visual needed to compare and contrast the human digestive system to the pigs. Being that the model is life size, they would also see the approximate sizes of the various organs. Having the fetal pig as well as a life size model of the human digestive system, we could see how similar the parts, placement, as well as function of the organs are. This would allow for excellent class discussions on xenotransplantation, similar origins, etc. By being able to take out the parts and open them up, hopefully they will be able to see the big picture.\n\nYour contribution to the human digestive system model will allow the visual that so many of them need. Some of us can read about a topic and understand it immediately. My students typically have learning needs that requires me to teach with visuals. I am not the kind of teacher who has them read and answer the questions on the chapter (I don't even use textbooks!) so materials like this have a critical place in my classroom. "

Seeing Science happening in everyday life makes it more understandable, more approachable and not so overwhelming.  Our school is so small we do not have a library that would normally house these materials. \n\nOur students are unique as are all children but with a twist.  The students are currently or just recently homeless.  In most ways they are typical kids.  They play, laugh, have fun, etc.  Their home life is very atypical.  Above all else they are still expected to learn like all other children but with little to no experiences to pull from.  Most have never been to places many children frequent like amusement parks, restaurants, malls, etc.  Taking them to these experiences through something like a video helps them to at least see places that they can only imagine ever going. \n\nThese videos will give our unique students an experience to see Science in action.  We will use these to help students connect real world science experiences to what they are learning in the classroom.

With an E-reader they can read books, have books read to them and play educational games. \n\n100% of the students at my school receive free lunch.  About 60% of the students are second language learners. That means many parents don't speak English and have trouble helping their children with their homework.  Many of my students do have support at home.  Some of my students are on their own to complete their homework.  \n\nI am so convinced that putting e-readers in the hands of my kindergarten students is going to benefit them greatly. They will be able to read books, have books read to them and play educational games that can be tailored to their individual needs.   As we move into adopting Common Core (or National) Standards for learning, students being familiar and comfortable with technology is essential.  In the current climate of budget cuts, schools don't have the money for basic supplies, much less technology. But I don't want my students to miss out.  I know that having access to technology is going to open up a whole new world of learning for them and the best part is that they see it as HAVING FUN! \n\nIt is vital that my students are engaged in meaningful activities that support their learning to read while I work with small groups.  E-readers are very versatile tools that will help me reach and teach each student to meet their individual needs.   "

They are excited to read books again and it has been great fun letting them read the books that they like instead of just decoding books and reading practice-type books.  \n\nWhile I will be working with a small group, the other groups need to stay engaged with their own, just-right reading. The CD listening center will help those students who need extra help in books that they are interested in, but also need that little extra help with reading some of the words in the text.  \n\nStudents will be so excited to come to the center and have a really fun book read to them as they follow along and decode the text at the same time. They are especially excited about starting the Magic Tree-house series CD set that I already have.  "

Help us to create a healthy, artistic space so that they can thrive and heal through the art of music and storytelling.  \n\nWithin our small school community, we have the privilege of intervening in our students lives. We have a close-knit community, and are able to greatly serve our students because of our small teacher to student ratio. Our responsiveness to our students is always contingent upon the resources that we have to offer them. Recently, after meeting with many of our student artists, we learned that they are seeking a musical space to develop their multiple intelligences, tell their stories, and create community amongst their peers through music. We have a vision to create this space so that our students can continue to thrive.  \n\nWe are asking for a number of resources to develop a music studio. Many of our aspiring artists are not able to compose or record their music because they cannot access monetary resources for music production. Studio time is costly, which hinders our students from accessing them. If we are able to secure microphones, monitors, speakers and other studio needs, our students will be able to learn the art of music production, a skill that will benefit them in future endeavors.  \n\nIf we are able to access these much needed resources for our young people, we will be able to teach them a few valuable lessons: \n\n1) There is a greater community that desires to see them succeed\n2) Their school community is invested in their success\n3) By telling their stories, they have the power (and now resources) to change the world. \n\nThank you for investing in our young people's lives!

These students are willing to make the extra effort and I feel with the right equipment these students will not become frustrated and finish high school.  My students have put their education first and have decided that gaining their high school diploma is a priority for them.  Math is not easy for my students and without a calculator it makes it seem almost impossible.   With these calculators, my students will be able to believe that although their current life situations may be difficult and challenging, they will be able to come to school knowing that their classroom will have the resources they need to be successful. \n\nPlease help me help my students to change their lives by having calculator at their disposal to use in their math class.

Many of my students come from families that do not have the knowledge and/or the resources to recycle at home. My students are also at the perfect age to begin the healthy habit of recycling. They are the future of our world, and we need to teach them from an early age to respect and take care of our planet.

They have disabilities that have affected not just their schooling, but their ability to socialize and be fully independent in their daily lives. Even with the challenges they face, my high school students with moderate to severe disabilities put their all into the tasks that I present them with. My students attend a public high school in Kentucky, where they are striving daily to learn the academic, functional, and life skills that they will need after their school career is finished. My students encourage me every day to be a better person and to remember to be grateful for every challenge that I face. They have taught me to be more patient and to learn from every adversity.\n\nI am requesting materials that I need for my classroom such as hanging folders, toner for my printer, a bulletin board for displaying student work in the classroom, pens, etc.. I recently tried to order an electric pencil sharpener with my school funds and was told that it was not a necessity since we have a pencil sharpener on the wall. I have many students with physical disabilities that hinder them from being able to use this pencil sharpener on the wall, so along with the other materials I am also asking for an electric pencil sharpener. This electric sharpener, along with the shredder that is being requested, will allow my students to also practice job skills that they could use to secure a job after school, not to mention, to be more independent in their daily tasks. I am also asking for 2 Leapster Explorer cases and many Leapster Explorer games. Currently, my class has 2 Leapster Explorer handheld systems, but only 2 games. My students enjoy the games, and they're educational! \n\nAs I have previously mentioned, without the funding from this project my students would not be able to have such materials. We have been successful in the past with previous projects being funded. It's through contributions and projects such as this that my students are able to continue to grow and reach their full potential! Thank you so much in advance for your help!  "

Illuminating Science with Color,"The gift of this printer would make a huge difference for my students.  Through a donation you are not just giving them the gift of a piece of technology, but rather the ability to open their eyes to the scientific occurrences of our world.  Thank you!",My students need a color inkjet printer and 4 ink cartridges.,"No child should receive a substandard education based on the neighborhood they live in, their race, or their socioeconomic status.  Unfortunately, this is not the case in our country today. Children who attend school in high income areas score much higher on standardized tests and perform much better academically than their peers who attend schools in high need areas.  The mission of Teach for America is to close this achievement gap and ensure that all children receive an excellent education.  It is this mission that brought me to North Carolina upon graduation to teach science to 150 high need 6th graders.  My students face both the challenges of adolescence and the challenges of living in poverty.  This combination can cause school to not be top priority, and I see it as my job to partner with their families to ensure that my students know all the doors that a quality education can open for them. \n\nIn order to invest my students in the benefits of an excellent education I aim to teach using as many best practices as possible. One of these best practices is the utilization of technology. There are numerous benefits to using technology in the classroom.  Unfortunately, my school district is one of many facing substantial budget cuts.  My school is unable to afford many basic supplies, let alone innovative classroom technology.  \n\nWhile expensive, innovative technology would be an incredible gift, I'm confident my students needs can still be served using much more basic technology.  Students in 6th grade tend to learn through visuals.  Our classroom textbook is a great resource, but is somewhat lacking in accessible, concrete examples for my students to relate to.  Due to the lack of color printing available at my school, all additional images I give to them are black and white.  These images do not have the same impact for my students as bright, colorful images would.  My students would greatly benefit from seeing different parts of the world as they are in nature.  A classroom color printer, and ink cartridges to make the printer fully functional, would greatly benefit my students.  The printer would ensure my ability to offer students multiple examples of scientific phenomenon and would allow me to effectively supplement the class textbook. \n\nThe gift of this printer would make a huge difference for my students.

Science is one area where their experiences are limited, but greatly needed to be knowledgeable about the way the world works.  Therefore, I am asking for science materials that would allow my students to experiment in areas such as light, sound, electricity, states of matter, volume, capacity, rock formations, etc.  The materials I am requesting will help my students learn firsthand what makes our world tick and provide them with experiences that will enable them to obtain knowledge that otherwise would not be available to them.

The printer can be used to import information and pictures as a scanner, and then publish class or club projects.  \n\nThis will further develop our technology and better prepare students to be able to compete in an increasingly technologically complex world. Colleges are more reliant on using tablets and computers instead of traditional textbooks, and for those students who are unable to purchase one on their own, they will be ill prepared to use in the future. This will help them develop necessary skills to succeed in their post secondary plans.  "

Today there is more and more emphasis on making students active participants in their math education. The internet has become a wonderful resource in my classroom but not everyone is getting the same time to explore. \n\nWe have a large student population but we are lucky to be a in a well funded district. The specific population that attends my school is a bit more disadvantaged than other high schools in the district, most officially considered at-risk of graduating. Home internet access isn't a given, high school and college educations at home aren't a given. Often their most technologically rich experiences happen inside the classroom. \n\nThe iPads I am requesting will incorporate into an existing class set of 8 iPads that have been provided by the school district. I have class sizes that average 28 students, so often 8 iPads is not enough to give every student equal time. Last school year I was able to develop some unique explorations that would've not been possible before the iPads gave the students personalized access to the internet and advanced graphing tools. Increasing the size of the class set will reduce the size of the student groups that have to share and allow me to make more individualized lessons surrounding use of the technology. \n\nI have had a lot of success with iPads in the classroom. Students have been able to research information right at their desk without the need to book a computer lab. We've been able to share pictures and photos with one another to better understand a concept we've been studying. We've had access to higher resolution graphing utilities that offer a lot more flexibility than our traditional graphing calculators. Increasing the size of my iPad classroom set will help push this initiative further. "

Most of my students lack the internal motivation to do well in school. \n\nBecause of this, I like to take advantage of every moment within the day to connect my students to their education. That even includes their 'free time' where they get to play games, but only educational ones.  \n\nI have to have several reward systems going on in my room in order to get my students to try their best on their work. I give rewards for behavior, grades, and homework. One of their rewards is some 'free time' on Fridays. \n\nTheir free time consists of educational games, where they are having fun and not really aware they are also learning at the same time. My current games are all missing pieces and no longer functional. It would mean a lot to my kids to have new supplies this year. I have requested an Action Games set, and different Bingo math and reading games.  \n\nMy request is so important to my students because they need every opportunity to learn something new.

Some of our students have few opportunities to be active outside of school or access to necessary medications for problems like ADHD. As a result, most of the time they are their own worst enemy when it comes to their education. The staff at our school are always looking for new and creative ways to combat this. \n\nIn order to try out this idea, we are requesting 15 exercise balls to give to our most active students. The idea is if they are able to sit and bounce in one place that they'll be able to get some of their fidgeting out while still bring productive. We have tried things like bungee cords on the bottom rungs of their chairs for their legs to bounce on our hand held medicine balls for them to squeeze. Overall we have had success with these strategies. We now would like to try replacing their chairs with exercise balls in order to see the effectiveness on productivity as well as behavior. \n\nResearch has shown that these exercise balls can be effective across a range of ages and in most classroom settings. By allowing students the opportunity to get some of their wiggles out they are more likely to focus on their task and less likely to be a distraction to themselves and those around them.

Some are just pictures broken into 3, 4, or 6 cards to sequence, and these we would use to instruct on what sequence is, why it is important, and then use them as story starters to help inspire kids to write a sentence about each one (which would add up to a paragraph!).  I am also asking for some sequencing sets that can be used in centers for kids to practice putting things in order and then checking that their work makes sense. I am also asking for a kit with sequencing tiles that encourages kids to write a story form the pictures, and a nursery rhyme sequencing activity that reinforces reading skills as well. \n\nThese sequencing puzzles, cards, and activities will help reinforce the basic skills kids need to be able to take a small moment in time and stretch it into several individual sentences that describe character, setting, problem and sometimes solution.

I work with 20 Special Education/Inclusion students in grades 5 and 6.  \n\nMy students range in disabilities, with most being specific learning disabilities. I have one visually impaired student. My students are eager to learn, but sometimes have difficulty grasping the material in the regular classroom. These students have moved mountains this year as far as progress and the majority are at the top of their class. The students are very hard workers. When they come to my room, we work on specific skills that they are working on in the classroom. This allows the students a double-dose of the material in a smaller, one-on-one setting.  I have a set schedule of when each student comes so that the needs of every student are met. We try to do center work, but this becomes difficult when materials are not as readily available as I would like. I work at a relatively small school in a very rural area. We contain grades K-8, with only 3 special education teachers on staff.  \n\nBecause materials are limited in a special education setting, an iPad would provide students with a vast array of apps to aid in their education journey. Being that technology is so prevalent, the addition of this resource would allow my students to dig even deeper when practicing new and previously taught skills. With the amount of apps available, I can have access to specific tasks and programs that could target each student I work with. Some of my students are on Kindergarten levels in reading, while others are on 6th grade levels in reading and math.  We have computer programs in place at the school, but my students need even more than what is provided. I would incorporate an iPad as both an individual center as well as an incentive for hard work.  \n\nMy students work for incentives and praise. With the addition of an iPad, my students would push themselves in order to be able to work on the iPad. This would also teach the students about responsibility when caring for a tablet. My students need as much encouragement as they can get.

They're curious, like to learn by doing, and love to play in the dirt! \n\nMy first grade students eagerly welcomed a sweet, floppy-eared, baby bunny this fall. His curiosity and spunk often reminds of the infamous “Peter Rabbit,” who just barely made it out of Mr. McGregor’s garden. Despite their persuasion, we have yet to put ours in a blue sweater with gold buttons! Our rabbit, Honey Bunny, also shares a love for fresh-from-the-garden herbs and greens. I think it would be a monumental learning experience to bring literature to life and create our very own “Peter Rabbit’s Herb Garden”. This cross curricular project will allow learning through meaningful activities. These students would benefit and be delighted to get their hands in the dirt and work hard to produce a meal for Honey Bunny, who they all are in love with. \n\nThis experience will develop student knowledge and real-world application of multiple content areas. These include the importance of farming, healthy habits, nutrition, science, and school wide character traits such as responsibility, team work, perseverance and cooperation. \n\nThis project will be a lens for studying people/plant connections in different historical eras or region. The Youth Garden Guide, which is included with the EarthBox, is correlated to the standards-based support curriculum. Lessons are project-based and encourage critical thinking. There are even lessons on workforce skills like marketing and data collection and analysis. This authentic learning experience will promote life-long lessons and memories. "

I-clickers are hand held computer devices that students can use to quickly answer questions that the teacher presents. \n\nI have title 1 students who love to learn and think that learning is important to becoming a successful adult.  In our modern age these students need to learn and use resources that they will be using as adults.  Currently many college professors use these same devices in their classrooms. \n\nWe are requesting a set of 24 i-clickers.  These i-clickers allow each student to quickly respond to the teachers questions.  The students answers are immediately sent to the teachers computer and then projected on a screen at the front of the room.  The teacher can immediately identify what students are having trouble and address the needs of those students.  These i-clickers save time and money! \n\nThis project is important because students need to have their individual needs quickly addressed.  As students needs are quickly addressed, they are then able to keep up with the modern world that they live in. "
Help DC Preschoolers Gain Literacy Skills!,"Preschool children are building relationships with the world and finding their place in it. We play with rhyming words, isolate new words in poetry, and change words around to challenge our students with memorization and prediction.","My students need basic literacy skills, and engaging kinesthetic needs with the I Can Spell Activity Mat, Rhythm Sticks, and Magnetic Alphabet Fish will be fun!","Did you know that it's estimated 36% of Washington D.C. residents are functionally illiterate?  That poverty-stricken children start out with significant developmental disadvantages?  Teaching pre-school students literacy skills through engaging, kinesthetic activities yields significant results. \n\nMy Pre-school students at a Title 1 charter school in Washington, D.C., are joyful, curious, and eager to learn.  3 and 4 year old children are endlessly curious, and they learn through their senses, which is why we teach through play.  \n\nOur school is a preparatory track charter, meaning we challenge students academically and emphasize character education.  Ensuring we are educating responsible future citizens is important to me, and our school does this through Second Step social skills curriculum, a variety of family outreach events (from Literacy and Math nights to Father Figures dinners).  Further, we provide two healthy, locally sourced meals per day for our students, and have an on-site organic garden that our PS-8th grade students help maintain.  \n\nWe are truly a special place for children and families who are committed to putting their child on the path to college, even from the earliest ages. \n\nFor example, we teach syllables for words through clapping or stomping, and the Rhythm Sticks I've selected will be endlessly useful during our Songs, Word Play, Letters portion of each day.  During that time, we 'play' with language to pique children's curiosity and interest in how words are formed.  We play with rhyming words, isolate new words in poetry, and change words around to challenge our students with memorization and prediction.  \n\nPreschool children are building relationships with the world and finding their place in it.  By playing with language and letters in the Beginning Sounds game, we are able to effectively scaffold questions on letter or sound awareness. This way, we can increasingly challenge students based on their abilities. \n\nThis project will broadly impact my students this year, and future classes, by engaging students with language through hands-on, manipulative activities.  Letter play today yields future readers! "

My students come to me from their urban war-zones to get their daily dose of education, safety, enrichment, and love. Our school is a charter school. In other words, parents are TRYING. They are doing their best with their multiple part-time jobs to be a good parent, but they care enough to bring their child to a school with a healthier situation and educational outlook than the public school system. \n\nMusic education provides enrichment for these students that they cannot get anywhere else. It helps students to learn ALL subjects through the lens of music. Motivation is key to success and my Music class provides that motivation. My students have become exceptionally proficient in rhythm because we are blessed to have a classroom set of rhythm instruments. In order to help form their tonal awareness, I need instruments that will help them learn the theory, visualization, and hands-on performance aspects of melody. My students will have countless opportunities to read music, accompany songs from cultures around the world, play alone and with others, and perform for an audience while using boomwhackers. \n\nStudents will be more motivated than ever to learn, not only musical applications, but also core subjects by using boomwhackers. They are an essential gateway to melodic proficiency by combining learning with ""wacky"" fun. "

I am hoping to create a water and sand sensory station, many of my students need extra sensory stimulation and a sand and water table would be an excellent way to do this. The stimulation and manipulation of two different materials would help them focus, and become more aware of the world around them. \n\nThis project helps move us one step closer to closing the achievement gap in the state of MN. Many immigrant and low income students simply do not have the opportunities that other children in upper-middle class families have. My students deserve to have every opportunity other children have, and this sensory station would be a great place for them to begin using different parts of their minds, and opening new doors for their futures.

Learning To Love Books and Reading with a Listening Center!,"My students need a listening center that can allow them to interact with books meaningfully on their own, or in small groups.","My students need a cd/cassette player, headphones, and a way to store all of those materials in a safe way to allow students to independently connect with books and to be inspired by books and instilled with a love of reading, even when they cannot read fluently themselves. ","Hello, I am a teacher with a unique classroom that is a combination of Pre-Kindergarten, Kindergarten, and special education inclusion students in Hawai'i.  I have 17 wonderful students from many different backgrounds and cultures, and our classroom is full of love and interest in learning, despite the hard lives my students face when they head out of my classroom each afternoon.  My school is in a very low income area of Hawaii, and our academic successes are few and far between.  My job is to inspire students at a young age to want to learn and succeed in school, and to let them know that school and a good education are tickets to a life many of their family members have only dreamed of.\n\nStudents in my classroom have almost no interactions with books outside of school.  They are not able to read books themselves because of their low literacy skills, and they are not usually read to at home because of busy family lives, illiterate parents and guardians, or just a lack of books to read at all.  \n\nBecause of this, my students LOVE to be read to during school time.  They love hearing books for fun, or to learn about a topic- they love hearing any kind of book I can pick up and share with them.  \n\nI am finding it challenging to get students excited about books when they are reading independently, however.  They are not able to relate to many of the usual school books because they come from such unique cultures, and such alternative family lives.  They have not seen many of the things in books, and therefore cannot gain meaning from them when they try to read the stories independently.  They get frustrated trying to read books when they have no background knowledge on the book's subject and when they have limited literacy skills.  I am worried that in the process of learning to read, my students will become more frustrated than inspired.\n\nMy students need a listening center that can allow them to interact with books meaningfully on their own, or in small groups.  A listening center with a CD or tape player would allow me to use my school and community library resources to find books on tape and cd that my students could listen to as they follow along in paper books.  This would give them a chance to understand a book, learn to love it, and then want to work hard to read it.  My higher level students who already have developed some reading skills, would be able to further their skills by matching words from the listening center with words on the pages of books.  My students who come from non-English speaking households would be able to match words with pictures and improve their language skills.  My reluctant readers would become interested in books because reading on their own would not be so hard and unrewarding for them anymore.\n\nHaving a listening center would be deeply motivating and empowering for all of my students, regardless of their culture, background, or literacy skill level.  They would be able to truly connect with books and to WANT to read them!  They would be able to enjoy books in a way they have never been able to before, and all because of your generous donation.  Please help my students learn to love reading, and make an immediate improvement in the quality of their education."

Students debate the use of growth hormones one day and fix fences the next day. \n\nOur school is host to the only therapeutic riding program in an urban setting.  Therapeutic riding involves the use of horses to improve social, emotional, behavioral, and physical well-being of our students, especially our special needs students.  \n\nAs part of the animal science curriculum, students of all abilities can learn to ride the horses.  The special and regular education students work as a team while learning to ride.  The students practice in a mixed group and work together to groom and saddle their horses.  They take turns riding and give each other advice on posture and riding tactics.  They laugh and joke with each other and develop deep friendships through their common love of horses.  \n\nThese moments deserve to be captured and shared.  From the ground, as instructors, we see them sitting straighter in the saddle and developing greater self confidence.  Our students will work together to develop video and picture journeys of their practice and competitions. \n\nSome students have never walked and their horse gives them legs.  Some students never talk and their horse listens to their commands.  Some students never reach out to others and their horse reaches out to them.  This program changes the lives of our students and the world deserves to know.  \n\nWe need a camera to facilitate student journals and to share our program with our families and community.  The pictures and videos will provide us with data to chart growth and validate the impact of riding. "
Studying World History Through Documents,"Your assistance will aid my students in preparing for their exams, enrich their study of history and help them prepare for college and all that lays ahead of them.","My students need 35 primary source readers for AP World History / NYS Regents Global Studies.  The text is ""World History in Documents: A Comparative Reader"" and is recommended by the College Board.  ","In my classroom, history is truly an engaging and fun subject for the students.  I am a teacher in a high-need high school and thus face all the challenges and rewards that go along with that.  My schedule this year is four classes of Global History I (freshmen) and AP World History / Global History III (sophomores). \n\nThe AP program is new in our school this year and while we have many capable and enthusiastic students we unfortunately do not have the resources to buy the necessary materials. \n\nAs a Social Studies teacher I feel that the use of primary sources in my classroom is both exciting and essential.  Not only will this text: ""World History in Documents: A Comparative Reader"" prepare my students for both the AP World History Exam and the NYS Global Studies Regents Exam, but it will enrich their learning experience.\n\nAnother important component to this project is that because this textbook is at a college reading level it will prepare my students for their college studies.  It is important that my students are exposed to this kind of work early on.  Not only will this prepare them for college but by raising expectations due to the level of the work I believe that my students will rise to the challenge and feel empowered.\n\nBecause students can receive college credit if they do well enough on the AP examination, this text will enable them to get a headstart on their studies at the university level. \n\nWhat better way to study history than through primary sources?  It is all well and good to learn about John Locke's writings (and essential) but it is necessary to examine his Treatise on Government, for example,  firsthand.  Additionally, this text provides students with thought-provoking and critical thinking questions which aid in guiding the students while reading these often challenging but ultimately rewarding texts.\n\nYour assistance will aid my students in preparing for their exams, enrich their study of history and help them prepare for college and all that lays ahead of them.  \n\nThank you so much for considering my project."

They come from many diverse cultures, religions, and backgrounds. They have varying levels of ability, however, they are all eager to learn. They are kind, cooperative, and caring citizens who deserve an equal education. \n\nI am requesting a Samsung Chromebook (laptop). Having an additional laptop will increase the opportunities my students have to access the Internet while in the classroom, a task that has been compromised due to a computer that has not been functioning since the beginning of the year. Students will use the Chromebook to learn more about the world around them through online articles, as well as to play brain-stimulating online games that allow them to practice needed skills in math and reading. Additionally, a laptop can provide experiences especially important for ESOL students like listening and viewing animated educational websites. \n\nYour help will make a difference especially for those students who do not have access to a computer at home. A new computer will give the students more access to the world around them and your help will show them that people out there really care. "

They attend a rural Title I school where approximately 78% qualify for free or reduced lunch services.  In my class this year, 96% of my kids qualify for these services.  This means that a lot of our kids are not able to be exposed to the newest technology that is offered.  \n\nWe have a few iPads in our classroom, and my students yearn to work on the them.  However with 20+ students, just a few iPads don't go a long way!  I would use the additional iPad to let my students work alone or in small groups researching other cultures, civil rights leaders, and other ethnicity groups.  Our students are not exposed to different cultures and really don't have the experiences or resources to learn about and appreciate the diversity of our world.   \n\nI want my students to be tolerate and compassionate of all races, ethnicities, and culture groups.  Without exposure to these other groups that are not around them every day, our students won't be able to see that we are all the same if not on the outside, most definitely on the inside!  "

These students who did not grasp the concepts the first time, I can work one on one with.  Students can also work together and explore science concepts they missed due to being absent. \n\nThis year our science units increased from four to seven units. With no kits to review and no hands on activities the students do not get the higher order thinking that is required by the required testing.  Our struggling students needed to repeat concepts more that once in some of these deeper science ideas. Due to limited supplies we cannot allow experiments to be done but once.

I could not believe the response that I received from the children. I found that they were focused and many of the students used the techniques presented in their own writing. The students also marveled over some of their peers' work, that I used to demonstrated model writing. They were amazed to see the work on the overhead. \n\nMost importantly, the student that got to see their work on the overhead, became stars for the day. I could not believe how motivating that was. \nMy students need overhead transparencies.

My students with Autism come to me with a diverse range of needs: socially, emotionally, behaviorally, and academically. Yet the ONE thing that they ALL share is a love for technology and the ability to LEARN from technology. \n\nMy classroom has three grades: Kindergarten, First, and Second, so my students are typically ages 5-7. Most of my students struggle with school work and with their own behavior. There are calm, quiet days... and then there are other days that completely exhaust me. But I treat my students as if they were my very own children. \n\nI promote the three main guiding characteristics of our school: Being Safe, Respectful, and Responsible. I believe that all children can learn, and our Special Education classroom is just like the other general education classrooms at our school. My two aides and I really push our students to achieve to the highest of their ability. It is not a classroom where kids play with toys or watch movies all day... It is a classroom filled with the support that the students need in order to read, write, listen, speak, comprehend, and grow.  \n\nI have worked with students with Autism for a total of 11 years now. I have met quite a variety of students. But the one common thing that they all share is that they all respond extremely well to technology. Sometimes they actually respond better to technology than to human interaction! To you and me, this may seem strange. But for students with Autism, sometimes human interaction is too intense or confusing for them. \n\nI wish to have an iPad in my classroom for a number of reasons. It can be used as a rewarding incentive, but more importantly, as a teaching tool. Because iPads are smaller than a computer but bigger than a cell phone, they are the perfect size. My students often don't understand when I talk about new things, such as an animal they've never heard of. But if I am able to show them a real-life picture of what I'm talking about, they are able to comprehend what I am talking about. My students would also use the iPad for learning/academic games, which would be wonderful!  \n\nTo have an iPad in our classroom would be a dream come true for me! Many general education teachers at my school have iPads for their students, and when my students visit those classrooms, they LOVE using the iPads. They light up with excitement! I would like to be able to provide that excitement in my own classroom. I know that our iPad would be used every single day, throughout the day, for both small-group and large-group lessons of all kinds. My students would benefit tremendously! "

My students come from families where earning money at a part-time job or babysitting for a sibling while the parent works often takes precedence over completing homework or being able to participate in extra-curricular activities. Although most of my students were not born into families that have excelled in academics, they have the capability and desire to be challenged and succeed academically. \n\nAcademic Decathlon provides an opportunity to work collaboratively and intensely with other students on ten disciplines including the usual math and science, along with music, art history, and giving a speech all focused on a designated annual theme.  Despite attending a school that ranks as one of the lowest performing academically in the state of California, our school's Academic Decathlon team has routinely performed better at the annual competition than many higher ranked schools which have multiple coaches and resources at their disposal.  This has been possible due to committed coaches, students, and administration.  The DVDs and CDs I am requesting will greatly enhance the learning process by bringing to life the large quantity of written material they have to read about the Great Depression so that they can perform at an even higher level than in past years. \n\nThis may seem like an inexpensive proposal, however with barely enough money to buy the written Academic Decathlon curriculum, having my school buy these supplemental DVDs and CDs is not possible.  Your financial contribution will allow my students to see and hear everything about which they are reading in their curriculum.

However, when a student walks in the front door on that first day and can put a face with a name it makes the transition just a little easier. \n\nWe are a semi rural school that serves approximately 475 students in grades k-5. We are the largest elementary school in our district.  Over 70% of our population are on free or reduced lunch and we also have a fairly high number of students moving in and out of school during the year. With all of these ""challenges"" we still have a group of kids that are anxious and eager to learn. We had above average growth on state assessments, few behavior referrals and we are also only school in our district that has a Spanish dual immersion program. When our students are provided with new chances to learn they embrace the opportunity with an energy that is contagious. \n\nBecause of the high move in move out many of our students come in nervous and uncertain about starting a new school. In my technology class I am currently working with  5th grade students on a photography/video unit. With the printer and ink/paper the students will be create a bulletin board in the front hall that has pictures of all staff in the building. In addition students will be working on their writing and keyboarding skills to write a short biography of each teacher to go along with the pictures. When we did this last year pictures were printed on an older inkjet printer and the quality was not great.

Though we are not currently a Title 1 school, we hover near that level of low income students.\n\n  I frequently have students who are more than one grade level ahead of the class as well as students who struggle with the names of letters and counting to 10.  It can be a struggle to meet everyone at their skill levels at not leave anyone behind.  This is especially true for the students who really need one on one intensive help to catch up.\n\nA Leapdesk workstation provides instruction in a wide variety of important literacy skills in an exciting and engaging way. Most importantly, the Leapdesk monitors a student's progress for me so that I can see what skills have been mastered and which ones need more work.  This relieves me from the time consuming task of testing and allows me to focus my time on instruction. A key additional advantage is that the Leapdesk is a tool that students are excited to try and look forward to using.  This is so important because struggling students frequently resist extra practice.  My first goal as a kindergarten teacher is to ensure that my students love learning, so I try to find the most engaging and exciting ways to bring lessons to them.  \n\nThe Leapdesk is a wonderful way to make sure that my students, especially the ones with low skills, are always moving forward.  Your help will allow all of my kindergardener to enter first grade as confident capable learners."
"Ms. D, Where Do I Put My Music?","Your donation of 20 new music stands would allow our musicians to have their own working space.

There are currently 3-4 students sharing the same space and it is often difficult for students, especially those with special needs, to concentrate when 3 other people are looking over his or her shoulder. Your help will provide a more effective musical experience as students will become accustomed to rehearsing like a professional group. Sharing a music stand with only one other person will help students form a more close knit relationship with their section instead of fighting because they cannot see the music. With just a few extra stands spread throughout the room, students can play more comfortably and have a more pleasant musical environment than they have now. When I am asked ""But where do I put my music?"" I can finally say ""Grab an extra music stand from the corner.""\n\n\n"

Many of my students require alternative communication devices in order to communicate with others. \n\nI teach a Primary (K-3) Life Skills/Severe Disabilities class in an urban, poverty stricken setting. I do not have access to as many resources as I would like. I currently have 9 students ranging in disabilities from Down Syndrome to Autism to Traumatic Brain Injury.  \n\nMany of my students are mostly non-verbal and need some sort of voice output device in order to verbally communicate. I can tell that they get very frustrated when people do not understand what they are trying so very hard to get across. I have found many great communication applications through the iPad that would help my students tremendously. I have also found that my students with Autism respond much better to doing assessments on the iPad than they do using paper and pencil. I have one student in particular who uses echolalia to speak and will not verbalize independently. The minute she began to use an iPad, she suddenly opened up and became much more expressive verbally on her own!  \n\nMost of my students will most likely never get another opportunity, besides in my classroom, to use technology like an iPad. I believe that incorporating technology into their everyday lives is very important in such a fast paced, technology driven world. "

We use personal white boards every day because it forces each student to work on their own -and activate their thinking - about EACH and EVERY math problem.  I can quickly and easily read the white boards to determine who needs extra assistance.  Using dry-erase markers on white boards in an integral part of my teaching. \n\nI love using white boards with dry-erase markers because kids love having their own marker and board; it is an instant activator to get students excited to work.  Every student is then allowed the time to work on a problem independently and the medium allows me to see their work - even from a distance. \n\nThis is an important gift because I have already used my own monies to get more markers. Now we need new ones for the remainder of the year!  I believe using this method in my teaching allows me to reach every student. Success for EVERY Student! "

We are a low socioeconomic public school and the majority of our students are second language learners. Even though they face many challenges, my students have a thirst for learning and a love of technology. They enjoy helping each other and creating projects for a real world audience. \n\nWe have made great strides in student achievement as a site, but it is important that our students have access to current technology. The technology that the students currently use was purchased seven years ago and doesn't keep up with their imaginations. \n\nI am requesting two iPad Mini's with cases for my students to use in the classroom. The iPad Mini is a versatile piece of technology that can take pictures, record sounds, and provide professional results to any project. The idea is for students to teach each other, because once you can teach a concept to others, you truly understand it. They will become ""Class Scribes"" whose goal is to provide notes and examples from the day's Math lesson to others. These math tutorials will provide students with a bank of resources to access when they are absent, or just need a little more time with the concepts. Because they are created by students for students and can be accessed from the class or from home, they will be an important addition to not only my own students, but students in other classes as well. \n\nThis project will have a major impact on student achievement in Math. Each child will have an opportunity to be the class scribe and create notes and visuals for their classmates to access. Students will be motivated to make sure their contributions are accurate. It will have an impact on not only math but on their writing and listening and speaking skills. Listening, speaking, and writing are also crucial skills our second language learners need to be successful. "

Too many of my students do not have opportunities to tell their parents little narratives nor do they hear parents enlighten them with funny, sad, or important moments of their lives.  It is essential then, that we at school provide opportunities for children to tell stories to each other, and to hear stories told by authors, teachers, and peers.  One way to achieve this is to allow our youngsters hear the language modeled by a variety of fluent speakers on CD.  \n\nI know the multiple copies of books with accompanying CDs will not only motivate my students to read, but allow them to hear professional narrators provide a fluent reading of a text that might otherwise be inaccessible to them. The students can follow along with the narration, removing some of the frustration of decoding the text.  As they listen, students can improve both their listening and reading skills. \n\nAs the smell of waxy crayons and clean erasers envelops the classroom, we look forward to a productive year with the help of generous donors like you."

That's where Night comes in.  \n\nNight is engaging, moving, beautifully crafted, and riddled with the elements of literature and persuasion that my students need to be exposed to. Last year, I taught Night with just 17 books for 36 students. Across the board, my students loved the book. But although they each tried to get their eyes on a copy to read it, many of them ended up simply listening to other students read it aloud. My students need to practice reading literature, not listening to it! Having enough books to go around the classroom will make a world of difference for these students. They will be able to fully engage with the text, reading it and analyzing the literary and persuasive techniques they have learned in my classroom.  \n\nThese books will make it so by the end of this semester, my students will be able to say with pride that every one of them has finally read, understood and genuinely enjoyed a book in English class. What a wonderful ""first"" for them.   "

They enjoy hands-on activities and performing for their classmates. Our Texas school is Texas-sized, which leaves our classes large as well. We're also a Title One school, which means that our student's are at high-risk for not graduating. \n\nHaving another xylophone in the classroom with allow more opportunities for these student's to play along with our daily activities. Right now, our student's have to take turns at each instrument. This leaves less time for them to perfect their technique and music reading skills. With another xylophone, these student's will learn that much more quickly. \n\nI believe every music student has been told ""practice makes perfect."" My student's are unable to practice at the best of their ability because they have to wait their turn to rehearse on an instrument. Most of my student's will only rehearse on a xylophone a handful of times. With few Orff instruments in the classroom, this also limits the amount of student's who will have the opportunity to perform such an instrument for our programs. "

Is what my kiddos are always asking me.  They love centers!  If you aren't familiar with what centers are, they are small group learning centers set up around the classroom during math or language arts time. They are student-led to reinforce what we've been learning. \n\nI am the proud teacher of 27 children on a military post in Colorado.  I teach a general education classroom with several students who have special needs too.  Many of my kiddos have a parent who is currently deployed or will be deploying in the next few months.  For many of my students, this isn't the first time that mom or dad have deployed either.  As you can imagine, this is a difficult situation for these young children.  I do whatever I can to make my classroom a fun and exciting place for these strong children to enjoy learning in. \n\nAll the items that I am requesting will be used for center work.

Can you imagine all the fun my kiddos would have while learning with all of these great educational facilitators? \n\nI hope that you might consider making a difference in my students' education.  I feel that since my students enjoy centers, the best way to further reach them and build on their educational potential would be to add to the activity they love the most.

Although their reading level is very low, they were able to follow instructions, begin to measure correctly, and take pride in their work. They are ready to begin building more items and working on new projects. I have a large computer lab with an abundance of floor space; however, our tools are limited to a few hammers, screwdrivers and tape measures.  \n\nUsing the requested resources, the students to participate in several different projects. For example, I have requested hand-cranked drills. The drills are much safer than a power drill in that the students provide the power. I already have a donation of several hundred golf tees, so I would like for my students to create ""Triangular Peg Board Games"". The students will need to measure the holes to 1/4 inches in order to create the game. Basically the only thing needed is the drills. \n\nUsing the additional hammers and nails, the students will create ""X Y Coordinate Plane String Art"". The students are given x-y coordinates that ultimately create a picture. The students will place their graphed picture on a piece of plywood and tap a nail into each point. Next, the student will pull the graph paper away and tie string (already available) around the nails to create a string art picture. WOW! Students will be using x-y coordinates to create a project they can be proud of. The wooden clock project is another project to continue on our thematic ""Building Brainpower"" unit. The students will need to follow instructions as they create a real world project. \n\nAs a dedicated educator I am certainly aware of the necessity for our students are proficient in math and literacy. However, my ultimate goal is to ensure my students will be productive citizens. Real world application of math and the use of practical application of instructions is not only workplace skills, but life skills as well. I am sad to say all of my students will not follow through to graduation; however, with your help we help them see the relevance of their education to the real world. Thank you for taking the time to read my request, I am confident if you knew my students and could see how engaged they become while working on this type of project, you would fund our project without hesitation. Thank you again!"

By September, I will have 16 amazing students that grow and thrive in an ECE through eighth grade school. Our school is a Title I school, with 99% of students on free and reduced lunch.  My students come from diverse backgrounds from language to money and families, but all of them have one dream at our school: to go to college! These students work hard everyday and I want to give them the tools necessary to take home something they are proud of at the end of the day. \n\nMost of my students do not have materials at home to practice and improve their fine motor skills.  In the classroom, I want to give them the resources to make choices, become problem solvers, and use their imaginations in an attempt to develop lifelong learners.  By giving them art materials, such as paint, paper, and glue, students are self-motivated to work hard and persevere when given challenges and difficult tasks.  Although these materials are used to make art, they are also used as an academic tool for activities in phonics, reading, writing, and math projects.  I want my students to have everything, and this is just one thing that I think will change the start to their academic life. \n\nWe all remember what it's like to be a little kid.  We love to paint, we love to get messy, we love to make our parents smile.  There are many things that engage and motivate kids, but giving them a paintbrush can change the way they learn.\n\n""Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember.

They deserve it and our school district just isn't doing that great of a job at providing such materials. \n\nOur seventh graders are a group of students that can not be easily described. As with any classroom we have students who speak their minds, jokers, social butterflies, introverted yet studious students, and the list goes on. I guess you can say that our classroom can be seen as a microcosm of the external community. And just like our community the effects of budget cuts and the sluggish economy can also be felt in our classroom. In fact our school was not even able to offer a single field trip to our seventh graders last year. We are currently planning at least one field trip this year but again funding is an issue. When I first entered the classroom, I was told that the only way to get equipment for my class was to ""beg, steal, and borrow."" While I did go ahead and beg, I decided to use my own money to buy supplies. But I have learned that such a course of action is non sustainable. So I now ask for your help. \n\nWell for one thing the students would now hopefully have a reliable pencil sharpener. Like I said before, we had two pencil sharpeners one provided by the school and another I brought from home. The one I brought from home still works but it is extremely loud. I hope that with this new pencil sharpener along with an electric stapler and hole puncher students can get used to this ""more modernized classroom."" \n\nWhen I first entered this school my classroom had an overhead projector and a broken desktop. I used my own resources and money to bring a projector, three laptops, a document camera, surround sound speakers, and many other basic school materials to the classroom. I probably spent two months of my pay in order to provide what I believe is a now more ""modern classroom"" for my students. If I had the money I would purchase this myself, but I don't. Anything helps! Let's make this happen. "

The notebooks create a bond with families and help the children talk about what they did at school during the week.  Students look forward to hearing from their families, and parents love the connection. They love the letters and the beautiful artwork, as well as being able to help improve their children's handwriting, spelling, and vocabulary. They enjoy seeing how their children progress throughout the year. \n\nAt the end of the school year, I add letters of my own, photographs of the kids taken throughout the year, a handwriting sample, and an ""All About Me"" book.

This year, through grants, we have given them opportunities to explore learning through hands-on activities.  This is when they shine.  Public school funding is being tapped out by State Testing and other mandates.  Because of this, we are limited in the number of creative experiences we can provide.  However we have seen first hand that this is when they learn best.  This is when they are enthusiastic.  This is how they develop their love and passion for learning. \n\nWe are hoping to set up creative learning centers for students. Centers would include an Illustrating Antonyms Center. Students would work with partners using Hot Dot pens to determine antonym pairs. They would then select pairs to bring to life with construction paper, scissors, glitter & glue. Work will be displayed on a classroom antonym board. Another center would be Compound Word Photo Frame. Students choose from words (ex. water & fall). They illustrate the words separately using the construction paper, etc. They would then create a compound word pair (waterfall). Work would be displayed in their frames. Another center would be a collaborative experience building possessive words on the easel. The kids make possessive words then use the wipe-off markers to add apostrophes to each other's words. The children will then use the people cut outs to create a picture that represents the possessive actions they built (ex. Jane is walking Bill's dog for him.). Partners evaluate and help edit. \n\nThis project would bring grammar and language arts skills off of the paper and into an exciting hands-on experience. We've all heard of the nightmare that schools are becoming due to the Common Core mandates. However, through creativity these mandates can be met. Rather than providing a stressful, lecture filled experience, this grant can help use provide a fun, hands-on, collaborative experience for the CHILDREN! "

This way, along with the other things we've done in class, they'll be well prepared to earn the college credit that they seek to receive. \n\nBy donating to the acquisition of the tablet, you will enable my students to get a step ahead, when they've been two steps behind for most of their lives. They will be able to earn a year's worth of college credit even before stepping onto a college campus. You will make a significant difference in the lives of my students and let them know that their hard work and determination are not in vain. "
Real Life Drama: Non-fiction,"Who needs fiction, when real life non-fiction provides enough drama to keep even the most indifferent teen reader fascinated?

As of...",My students need non-fiction books to both enhance the necessary skills to comprehend non-fiction and to learn about the world around them.,"Who needs fiction, when real life non-fiction provides enough drama to keep even the most indifferent teen reader fascinated? \n\nMy students are the most curious lot I have ever come across.  As of late, we have taken to discussing books we've read (I know!  A reading teacher's dream!).  The books I have been reporting on to them have topics like the Romanov family, or the Battle of Thermopylae; topics and events they never knew actually happened.  And the questions keep coming!  They ask deep questions like, ""What was going on in America when that happened?"" or ""Was that person my age?""  These questions show me a deep personal curiosity they have and that they also want to understand things on a global scale.\n\nThey attend a Title I urban school in an economically disadvantaged neighborhood.  Most of them are so isolated within the community they have never even been to the other side of town.  Non-fiction can help feed the curiosity and open doors for them. \n\nIf there is one thing teenagers thrive on, it's drama.  Real life has provided us with a cast of the most dramatic divas, epic events and civilization changing decisions.  The books I have selected for this project range in topic from the Little Rock Nine, to anatomy, to European history and almost anything in between.\n\nWith these books in their hands, students have more options for their independent reading choices:  They will no longer be held to choose from out-of-date non-fiction or isolated in the fiction section of the library.  \n\nAdditionally, students often struggle with the skills required to read non-fiction: Discerning facts and opinions, summarizing, making connections with other events or current society, and reading at a higher level with a specific lexicon.  Students need to practice, and these books offer compelling topics for them to read about. \n\nBecause of our conversations about non-fictions books I've read, my students often ask me, ""Did that really happen?!""  Just in case I am holding out on them, they have to know if what I am saying actually happened.  These books will not only help them with skills in the classroom, but will affect their lives beyond the classroom by broadening their horizons and enriching their lives.  They can become the person who gets asked, ""Did that actually happen!?"" "

However, I feel that many students need to be motivated to learn. I would like to give them an opportunity to interact and enjoy themselves while increasing their language abilities. Using materials like Magnetic World Builders, Phonics Flip Books and Scooter Scramble Sight Words Game, students will practice formulating new words and sentences, which will help in their reading and writing abilities. \n\nThink about when you were a child - what teacher or class inspired you? If you were anything like I was, it was the class that you were able to learn through interaction with peers. It was the class that was fun and exciting.

I have made it my goal to help my students become life long learners. I have found that when my students do labs they have those AH-HA moments that all teachers dream about. Lack of funding makes it difficult for me to do labs, for the past 5 years I have spent much of my own money trying to put together budget labs. \n\nBy having the supplies to do the homeostasis lab my students will be better able to understand the mechanisms of positive and negative feedback. They will also learn about what body processes are regulated by these processes, like thermoregulation. By having the supplies for the AIDS simutest I will not only be able to show the effects of infectious disease but make them more aware of how it may affect their lives.  \n\nLabs are important for all science classes, even more so in Anatomy because when students see these body processes in action they have a greater appreciation for their bodies. My favorite saying is ""take care of your body, there are no replacements"". Beyond students just learning content, I want them to be able to collect and record data, make predictions, and explain results, this cannot be done without labs.

I met with the male students and asked them what novels they would be interested in reading.  I had an overwhelming response.  They chose a few sets to begin literature circles with.  They expressed to me that they would like to add some variety to our classroom library and they feel like it would promote more male students to read for enjoyment and not because it was assigned. I buy books each year but with the budget crunch it is not possible this year.  I want my readers to read, read, read.

I do not want any student left behind because he did not have what he ""enjoyed"" reading.

Our sessions consist of: a weekly sound/letter of the week, age appropriate picture vocabulary, daily arts and crafts, and a story.  I always try to tie the sound, vocabulary, story, and art together to make a cohesive thematic unit.  I like creating thematic units because I understand that everyone learns differently; one student may learn new vocabulary through listening to a story, where another student may learn through doing (creating an art project), and yet another student might learn through a hands-on activity (using manipulatives).  My goal is to reach each student through these different activities, so that they can learn and experience new ideas! \n\nThe materials that I chose will all supplement thematic weekly units and will encourage the children to learn through different mediums.

This will enable me to differentiate instruction to many different levels of readers so that I reach the needs of all my students.   \n\nYour generous donation will go a long way towards helping a class full of eager learners discover new worlds through reading.

I'm already looking forward to it! \n\nI see 120 students in the fifth and sixth grade everyday. We are a small community school in a rural environment. I was sitting outside with them today enjoying the view of the surrounding farms and barns. They are a very smart, funny, and active bunch.  They will love all of the hands-on activities included in this project. \n\nIn this projects, I am requesting a selection of nonfiction books about living things.  I am attempting to build my science library. I love bringing in books to supplement the text book. I am also requesting owl pellets and a set of tweezers to pull them apart and see what's in there! I've never done this before but it sounds awesome! I know the kids are going to love it! Finally, I am requesting some items for physical activity.  That's always a plus! \n\nOur school doesn't really have an upper grade playground. When we go out to play, it is basically a field. Having some things to actually play with will be a thrill!  \nThe broader impact will be bringing science to life. Science branches out into so many other subject areas now and career choices later. I want to be sure to keep their attention! "

Most of my students qualify for free/reduced lunch and many have a poor quality of life at home. Less than a year ago, a tornado destroyed 1/3 of our town, and all of the students in my class were affected. Some lost homes, family members, or friends. All of us have lost our sense of ""normalcy"" while our city is trying to rebuild and recover. \n\nMy students will use the K'nex to build vehicles, and then test them to see how adjusting the amount of force, weight of the vehicle, etc. will change the speed of the car.  We will also use the K'nex to build structures showing how simple machines can be used.  I also have an electricity unit when students use their knowledge of electricity to build a ""Real world"" object.  Many of my students choose to use K'nex for this project as well.   \n\nDonating K'nex to our classroom will allow students to build and create during Science class, instead of reading about Science in a textbook.  My students learn so much more when they can experience the learning through experiments, and K'nex will allow them to learn a lot about motion, design, simple machines, and even electricity. "

They are all wanting to grow as readers and build stamina to read for longer periods of time.   \n\nWith the addition of the new beanbags, my students will be able to enjoy reading during our literacy block. We call bean bags in our classroom our ""Cozy Comforts"" because we want the children to feel comfortable and ""cozy"" while reading. The book bins also make it very easy for the students to find the genre of books they are looking for in the library. It helps organize the hundreds of books, so there is less searching and more reading! \n\nThis project is important because I want to instill the importance of independent reading in my students. This is such an important part of their learning path. I want to take away as many obstacles as I can and make it a successful path to becoming a lifelong reader! "

If students can improve literacy in Spanish, it will surely help them establish good reading habits, and hopefully inspire them to take charge of their learning. \n\nWe are in desperate need of appealing, and appropriate leveled texts in Spanish, our target language. The different leveled books that I am requesting will meet the needs of my students who are at all different levels of acquiring the Spanish language. \n\nI feel that reading is a great way  to acquire a second language, because as students read the stories, they are naturally learning grammar rules, new vocabulary, and finally an insight on culture. \n\nMy students will love having the opportunity to pick up a book of interest in Spanish while in my classroom. I require that my students complete a reading log for each semester. It will benefit them greatly if my library offered them an appealing selection of books from a variety of topics. "

Some of them have never met a Jewish person.  The last time I taught about the holocaust in this school an African American boy raised his hand and shared ""I never new there was another group of people who were hated just because of who they are.""  My students love to read nonfiction texts when they are interested in the topic.  They also love to make connections between what we read in English class and what they are learning in World History. \n\nIf my students can read ""I Have Lived A Thousand Years: Growing Up in the Holocaust,"" they will learn about World War II through the eyes of a girl their same age who experienced it herself.  They will be able to experience how powerful memoir is and then to explore the topic further in small groups and independently.  One of the supplementary books I selected ""Hitler Youth: Growing Up in Hitler's Shadows"" will allow them to explore the dangers of mass propaganda that still face us today. ""The Cage"" is another Holocaust memoir that will allow those interested to compare two connected memoirs.  ""Auschwitz"" is a nonfiction text with primary sources to supplement the information presented in the memoirs. \n\nAs the last survivors of World War II leave us, it is so important for students to learn about this horrific time in history.

Enter these journals. At the end of each week, we will set aside time for students to reflect on the prior week. They will check-in on the progress they have made toward reaching their short-term and long-term goals and share any and all relevant information with me. I'll review the journals each week, which will help me get to know and support my students better.\n\nThe journal exercise also represents a much-needed yet subtle way for the students to practice their writing skills. \n\nLet's face it - my students face long odds in getting into and eventually graduating from college.

Through this exploration, students will learn how to better deal with their emotions such as anger, anxiety, school avoidance, depression, and disappointment.  In addition, the staff will learn how to better support not only the student but the student's family.  This will lead to a stronger, safer, more fulfilling home life which will, in turn, allow students to enter their classroom ready to learn and focus on their education each and every day! \n\nLearning how to deal with emotions is a skill that is essential for a person to lead a healthy, productive, and successful life.

My students are often first or second generation immigrants from all over the world who not only value an education, but are the hardest workers I have ever met.  My students don't just receive a grade; they desire specific feedback, coming in before or after school to have assignments clarified, expanded upon or corrected.  They soak up words and ideas, but they are challenged by language and economic obstacles.  As their teacher, I am constantly striving to find strategies that will create the ""aha"" moments when learning is no longer something to be ""sludged"" through but when it becomes pleasurable and an end unto itself. \n\nThese resources will culminate in a notebook where students will store ""foldables,"" cut-and-pasted reading material with critical vocabulary and ideas highlighted and reflected upon, and their own word bank.

I am requesting a top of the line, durable electric sharpener that will hopefully last for many years to come. \n\nWhile a working pencil sharpener may not be the most exciting project, it is a basic need for our classroom, and one that will make a huge difference for my students.  We want to spend our class time on our learning and not trying to get pencils sharpened. "

They store all the pieces to their designs there, so it needs to be organized. After they draft their designs, they go to the tool chests to gather the pieces that make their designs come to life. They get so excited about something they imagined becoming a reality. I do not want barriers such as lost pieces to get in the way of their creativity. \n\nThis project is so important because it is something my students are excited to come to class to learn about. This excitement allows for them to learn to the highest standard and prepare for their future. It also creates a sense of pride in accomplishing their goals.

They don't receive opportunities to enhance their background knowledge which others may receive if they go on vacation for example. \n\nHere's some of the ways a document camera can increase curiosity and assist learning in my classroom:give students a chance to examine nature up close. Imagine never walking along a beach and holding a seashell. Now students can see the shell as I point out it's features. Students can look for patterns in nature,and examine rocks. This will encourage them to compare and contrast. In Reading and Writing,I will be able to point out capital letters and punctuation which are used to increase fluency. The large print and pictures increases students ability to concentrate and peaks their interest. \n\nPlease consider this project today so that all students will have the opportunity to see what is being taught as well as bringing my classroom tools up to the 21st century.

If they can have more in class practice with their teacher, concepts are more easily understood. These additional 5 remotes will help complete a class set so every student can have one - not just a few. \n\nOur school is in California, and my students come from diverse backgrounds. Our biggest obstacle is that we have almost 80% of our students on free and reduced lunch, and they do not have the resources at home to support their learning. We try to learn topics in a variety of ways so that all students can understand the Algebra topics being presented - which is difficult since most students cannot think in the abstract nor have had the life experiences to extrapolate from. They are all terrific, hard-working and exceptional - and I give them my best each and every day. \n\nWith the current financial situation in the state, we have increased class sizes. Right now, I have a response set that is incomplete and with these additional five response units, every student will be able to have their own to use. They love using them as they get immediate feedback on what they are working on. We take a topic, break it down, and check for understanding to see with the response units to make sure everyone is understanding the topic. It helps me, the teacher, see right away who understands and who doesn't. It helps me to group students together to have those students who understand what is happening help ""teach"" those who are not. Immediate feedback is the key - in order to keep students engaged in the learning, we (the teachers) need to provide immediate feedback so that they can realize if they are on the right track. \n\nAll I can say is that this will help my students a great deal. Actual practice is always the best. I tell my students that when Shaquille O'Neal couldn't make a free throw in the early part of his basketball career, he had to go out and practice until he could do them on a regular basis. That is what helps a student learn - practice and perseverance. I am hopeful that my project will be fulfilled as it will make a difference in my students' lives. "

The same is true for students who learn to reach their big goals by achieving little goals first. \n\nLearning to set and achieve goals is an ongoing process for the nearly 1100 ELL Title 1 elementary school students I teach. More often than not, even the smallest goals can be challenging and often frustrating for my English Language Learners, who struggle with more than academics. Our students hail from all over the world, with a large concentration from China. They speak over 20 languages and dialects, and learning to navigate in American English is the first hurdle they must overcome. They spend long hours at school in early drop off, extended day instruction, and late pick up after care. For our youngest students, the kindergartners, first and second graders, keeping even the smallest short term goals in mind can be frustrating. \n\nWhen the children come to see me in the gymnasium, they are happy, excited, and full of energy. Following simple directions, even in physical education and dance, becomes quite challenging. I find that offering stickers to the students who demonstrate self-control and concentration provides students with both immediate positive reinforcement of good choices and a lasting reminder of what they did that was worthy of remembering. This helps all of the students channel their energy towards the work they need to do. With so many little hands in need of immediate recognition of achievements, stickers get used up very quickly. We could use a new bunch of stickers to replace those we have already used. \n\nBy funding this project you will be purchasing a variety of new stickers to reward my students for positive behavior choices and the excellent work that they do in my physical education and dance class. Rewarding their little goals will help them reach their big goals and you will be sticking it to them one achievement at a time. "

The focus of myself and of my school is to meet the needs of all children in order for each child to succeed in school and to become a productive member of society. \n\nThe resource I've chosen to ask for will provide opportunities for my children to work cooperatively to practice the skills and strategies included in our curriculum, and also to involve parents more actively in their children's education.   With the Flip Video, I will be able to provide opportunities for interactive learning, as well as independent practice for children at varying levels of difficulty. Students and parents will be able to view projects, lessons, examples, and videos of my students.  They will be proud of themselves and excited to share their work via the computer with other members of our school community, and more importantly with their parents, who otherwise would remain uninvolved.

So, they need Time for Kids to help them out. \n\nMy students come from refugee camps in Asia and Africa, and from countries in the Middle East and the Caribbean.  They are trying to gain literacy skills in a new language while trying to master academic content.  For most, school is a new experience since they spent much of their lives in refugee camps.  They work very hard to learn reading and writing skills.  Many do not have reading and writing skills in their native languages so learning English is even more challenging. \n\nESL students, like all students, engage with current happenings in the US and around the world.  Time for Kids does a fantastic job of breaking down news events into accessible language and reading levels.  When my students have magazines that they can read, it will encourage them and motivate them to tackle the next highest level, and so on.  They can take these magazines home to their families and younger (and older) siblings to share.  It encourages literacy at all levels, most of all, in the family. \n\nLiteracy in the home, in school, and in larger communities is what instills success.  Time for Kids, through current and relevant material, engages children.  Having a magazine to take home and share with others furthers literacy.  For my ESL students and their families, these materials lead to family literacy which is essential to academic success in the US. "

Several children are either english-language learners or have Individualized Education Plans. \n\nIn order for these children to take interest in learning, they must first become independent learners and take charge of their own learning - teaching must appeal to multiple intelligences and learning styles and motivating young learners is essential.  Hands-on activities and centers that are kid-friendly are key in involving young learners and allowing them to actively engage in the formation of various learning experiences. \n\nWe need materials that will help organize and set up our writing center and motivate us to keep writing stories about our lives. We also need math manipulatives to help differentiate instruction and support students that are struggling with mathematical concepts and require more visual support.  We also need modeling clay for art-inspired science activities and word study materials that will help us internalize word wall words, explore sounds and practice writing high-frequency words.  These materials will help promote independence in the classroom and will reach out to the different types of learners in our classroom. \n\nYou will make it possible for my students to become OWNERS of their learning by immersing themselves in hands-on activities that will help bring words and mathematics to life.  These materials will help appeal to the multiple intelligences in my classroom,  spark enthusiasm in their young minds and will promote a love of words and learning in general that will brighten with each new learning experience they encounter."

As a teacher, I try to make learning as realistic as possible. Students can only come to fully learn about fossils by making their own! With these materials, each student will be able to make four different types of fossils. \n\nI have a lot of ADHD students who benefit from the hands on, real world application of the curriculum.  Sure we can read about fossils and look at pictures of them, but not ALL of my students will completely understand the differences between the four different types of fossils. By making replicas of the four types, students will be engaged and will come to truly understand how fossils were formed. \n\nThese resources will motivate and inspire my students. We will make replicas of four different types of fossils, as well as sedimentary rock samples, so that students will truly have a complete understanding of the science core curriculum. Who knows? We may have a future paleontologist in this classroom who will be inspired through the making of these fossils. You never know the impact you may have each day in the classroom! \n\nThank you so much for helping us out and allowing me to make science come alive in my classroom. Students will appreciate this hands-on approach to learning.  When they look back upon their 4th grade year, I can guarantee this will be one academic experience that they will remember for years to come. "

I want students to value mathematical achievement. In order to do this, I try and highlight student thinking in the classroom. Education is not about what I do, but what the students do. \n\nStudents in our school are generally lower income students. Around 35% of students are lacking a adequate foundation in numeracy. This leads to misconceptions in advanced math concepts and students becoming demotivated in the classroom. Students need to develop perseverance in challenging math concepts. To do this students need to be shown common mistakes and how to work through a challenging problem. \n\nMy students need a Document Camera and Dry Erase boards with pens to demonstrate their own math work. The whiteboards and document camera I have requested allow every student a chance to participate in their education. Every student will have the ability to demonstrate their abilities and also 100% of the students will be engaged. Allowing students ways to show the work ensures accountability for students thinking and allows them to exchange ideas.  \n\nQuality education is built on getting 100% of students engaged in the classroom. The items I have requested support this overall goal. White boards have become essential in mathematics classrooms. Every student has a chance to do the work not simply the ones at the board. "

This is a reality for many of my students. Reading diverse selections of literature will help them widen their realm of experience; unfortunately, however, most of our texts are by ""dead white guys."" \n\nThe majority of my students reside in the inner-city and are from low-income households; our entire student body is on free or reduced lunch, and many of them have limited access to books and computers. Additionally, our school is a title-one charter school with limited resources. Our students are not able to bring textbooks home because we do not have more than a class set at our disposal. Furthermore, in my experience, their literary tastes are very limited, and they are reluctant to read. It is my hope that having brand new texts and exotic-sounding reading selections will help to spark their interest. \n\nWith access to these books, I will be able to increase my students' knowledge and experience of the world, broaden their horizons, and help them to empathize with the experiences of other people who are different from them. Moreover, I will be better able to challenge them with high level reading selections according to our new curriculum and Common Core standards. \n\nWe are trying to transition into Common Core and a new curriculum this year, but we do not have the resources to do so. We need challenging, grade-level texts which align with our curriculum goals and standards and will help us teach our students how to sustain independent reading of challenging texts. We will only be able to reach these goals when we have enough of the texts recommended in our curriculum to send home with each individual student. "

Despite their hard work and the advances we have made together, I am concerned that a lack of resources is holding them back.  To help them improve, I need better basic instructional resources. \n\nIn order to address my students' diverse, acute needs, I am asking for funding for an overhead projector and screen. These items will enable me to model activities much more effectively than the chalk board and chart paper allow. This is especially important for ESL students, who need everything modeled.\n\nWith an overhead projector, I will be able to: \n\n* Project an image large enough so that all of my students are able to see clearly. I currently have students who often have difficulty seeing what I am doing, and this impedes their comprehension, thereby disrupting the flow of a lesson.\n\n* Make copies of diagrams on overhead transparencies, rather than take precious time to recreate them by hand (and not always with the greatest accuracy, no matter how hard I try!).\n\n* Use manipulatives to model ESL and Math activities.\n \nI have a lot of behavioral challenges in my classroom. Part of this is because of the various academic levels of my students, which is a constant source of frustration for them. I have to be able to challenge everyone, moving them along as efficiently as I can. Improving demonstrations would do this. \n\nI thank you in advance for understanding and offering your assistance.\n"

It is more enjoyable to listen to a person whose vocabulary is rich and varied. We are determined to grow our vocabulary this year! \n\nThese vocabulary-savvy students are seventh graders- mostly 12 and 13 years old. I would not be completely honest if I did not admit that they love to include these invigorating words in their writing: cool, stuff, thing, good, bad, and nice. Although these words serve a purpose in our English language, I just want to believe they would use stronger, more specific words if they readily had them in their personal word cache. It is imperative to their reading comprehension to continue to add new and useful words to their individual ""banks"" as they are challenged everyday through all media to increase their word knowledge.  Our school's language arts department and foreign language department strive to support each student as he or she discovers fresh and fun words. \n\nOur vocabulary instruction is based on the research of Dr. Robert J. Marzano's book, Building Background Knowledge for Academic Achievement. Marzano offers various ways to approach vocabulary, but most of all, he encourages teachers to use the Frayer Model along with graphics to help make connections that often get lost between the page and its process. \nWe will use the books requested from DonorsChoose.org as an effective, student-friendly place to gather useful, necessary words. Students will select 5 words each a week and work in small groups to investigate how and when these words are used then content and pics are drafted on index cards. \n\nIn essence, even though students begin with 5 words, they actually experience up to 20 words a week or more through group study. The individualized nature of this method will allow growth in all levels of learners. Wordsmiths can choose much of the content included on their cards based on his or her learning style \n\nOnce a person truly learns something, it is his or hers for Life! This project has the potential to give millions of new words to students in our present and future language arts classes. Written or spoken-- words are how we communicate.

The sky is the limit! \n\nAll donations toward the projector and document camera will directly affect student learning by making the web and internet more accessible and by providing a wonderful visual tool where students can much more clearly keep themselves on track, view pictures, see processes, and celebrate the work of their peers.  It changes everything! "

Math picture books will help bridge these areas. \n\nI work at a Title I school in North Las Vegas with an ethnically diverse group of economically underprivileged fifth graders. Many of my students have not had the opportunities to travel beyond the world of the Las Vegas Strip; yet, they are still incredibly eager to learn more about the world around them. I teach in an inclusion classroom with students of various ability levels. Our school recently transitioned from K-2 to K-5, so as a result, many of our materials are not rigorous enough to meet the needs of my young scholars. Additionally, we have adopted the Common Core State Standards in order to help our students compete academically with their more affluent peers. \n\nI am requesting a variety of picture books that will introduce various math concepts.  These picture books will be used in whole group and small group math lessons. The picture books help my visual learners connect with the material that is going to be introduced.  \n\nMany of my students feel defeated by math concepts in fifth grade. Thus, I want to ease their anxiety by introducing concepts in a fresh way using picture books.  This non-threatening approach will engage all learners. "

","Were you a student who always had your hand raised in math class? Or, were you a student who sat quietly, even when you didn't understand? I work in a mixed ability setting where some students get every concept immediately, while others struggle. \n\nOur students attend a school with a math and science focus. They are amazingly smart kids who work hard every day. About 40% of our students are special education students. Many of them are great at math, but everyone has certain topics where they're not as confident. Some of our students are current or former English language learners. Many of them are great at math, because it's the universal language, but feel uncomfortable speaking in front of big groups. We have two big classes with 33-36 students each, where it can be difficult to get to every student during every class. \n\nEvery day, we ask our students a lot of questions, but we often hear answers from the same few students. It's hard to tell if the students who we don't hear from are just shy, or if they don't get it. Individual whiteboards give me and my co-teacher an easy way to see each student's answer and look for problems. We can see quickly who's getting the lesson and who's still struggling. This allows us to target the kids who need help and challenge the students who are excelling. Whiteboards give us more flexibility in the classroom. Every student can quickly show us his or her answer to the 'Do Now'. When we play review games, every student can be involved, instead of just the students whose turn it is. We can even use less paper by having students solve problems on a whiteboard, not a worksheet! Whiteboards give us more data from more students in less time. Our students will be better prepared to tackle graphing, factoring, and solving equations. \n\nIntegrated Algebra is the basis of all higher math. We want to increase participation and make sure every student has a strong foundation in Algebra to excel on the end of the year Regents test, in later math classes, and in life. "

I wan to raise the rigor in my classroom and bring the magic of reading to my students. If we had a class set of books we could go in depth with many literary concepts while using authentic text. \n\nWe are a fourth grade classroom in colorful Colorado. My students come from a Title 1 school and they are hungry for books. They come everyday so excited to learn. Many of my students do not have books or supplies of their own, and many of my students have never read or heard of the Harry Potter book series. \n\nThese books would change our literary lives! We do not have class sets of books  for our grade so, this would be amazing! We could read as a class, have literary circles, and partner reading. The magic of the Harry potter books will inspire my students to continue reading the entire series. The Harry Potter books are perfect to use for teaching fourth grade standards such as Cause and effect, and literary devices. \n\nThis project is so important to me because personally I LOVE Harry Potter and I LOVE reading. I would love to see the love for reading develop in my students. I would love to share this with my students.  "

When this project is funded, students will have a fun, 21st century-relevant way to monitor and revise their reading and writing fluency. Parents will also be able to listen to the sweet little voice recordings of their student during conferences. \n\nStudents today like novelty. They are much more productive and on-task when given fun incentives, such as using any type of modern technology. These first grade students in my classroom are no exception; they will do anything to work on an iPad or get on a laptop and be in control of their own learning. Although we do have a few laptops in our room, and access to iPads occasionally, we could definitely use more technology that is geared toward student-use. During reading and writing workshops, I try to work individually or in small-groups to ensure learning gains, but it isn't always easy when other students are off-task or need redirection. Having more pieces of engaging technology will help students grasp the relevance of staying on task and working during unstructured periods of critical one-on-one instruction and conferencing. \n\nThe Hear All Assessment Recorder will be a valuable asset during Reading Workshop. In one work station, students are required to ""Read with Someone"", to improve listening skills as well as their own reading fluency. However, children will be children, and no matter how much modeling and practicing occurs in the classroom, they will eventually get off-task in this station and spend more time giggling and chatting about non-school topics than actually working on reading and listening skills. If students know their reading is being recorded, and may be played for parents at conferences, they are more apt to remain on task. They also, like to listen to their own voices, so its an incentive in many ways! The Easi-speak USB Recorder will help students during Writer's Workshop. With this tool, students can listen to a ""finished"" piece of writing they have recorded, and revise or edit any mistakes they ""hear"". These recordings can also be downloaded to extend our listening library! \n\nBy supporting this project, you are making reading and writing meaningful to young students in the digital age. They are getting to use technology; a desire now instilled in children almost, it seems, from birth! They are getting feedback not only from a teacher, but from a peer or (more importantly) their own understanding of how fluent readers and writers should sound. Also, parents of these students can receive tangible evidence of their student's performance in the classroom.  "

My kids work for a different kind of pay, a reward system paycheck. Not only will a reward system that pays them in minutes of laptop use help to support their academic journey but it, along with the money games played on it, will help their personal finance education. \n\nI have a self-contained special education classroom of 13 students who are eager to learn in their own way.  Many of my students are autistic and have difficulty focusing and learning using traditional teaching methods.  The school is a high poverty school with over 75% of the students receiving free and reduced price lunches. Funds are not available to allow many students access to I-pads, computers, or the Internet. \n  \n\nThe students in my self-contained special education classroom work for various rewards. When they work hard for a reward it needs to be something that excites them.  The diverse abilities of my students create the need for different teaching methods and motivators.  I would love to pay them for their hard work with minutes on a laptop.  Not only would they have something that excites them as a paycheck but the reward can also be educational with all the CD's available today.   I am asking for a laptop to be donated to my classroom so students will become more economically aware while working for the ability to use a new resource in the classroom.\n  \n\nDue to the limited funds available for teachers to purchase materials for their classroom, I have not been able to acquire these resources for my students. I would love for my students to experience learning with this new technology as they advance their personal financial education.  Please can you help make this happen!!!!!!\n  "

This is especially important for children impacted by Autism Spectrum Disorder, that sometimes struggle with accessing literature through text. \n\nMy students are kindergarten and first grade students impacted by Autism Spectrum Disorder and other communication related disorders. Children with Autism demonstrate struggles in the areas of social skills and communication, and also exhibit unusual responses to sensory stimuli and may demonstrate stereotypic and/or repetitive behaviors. Due to the impact of Autism, the children in my class have a difficult time accessing literature through text alone. In order to engage my students, I use as many mediums as possible, such as music, movement and illustration.\n\nBecause my classroom is a specialized classroom, my students come from all across our school district from a variety of cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. The level of resources my students have at home varies, and for some, school is the only place where they receive support for literacy in English. \n\nMy students love school, and are so excited about their opportunities for story time. \n\nIn this project, I am requesting an iPod nano, as well as a speaker system. At story time, I would like to engage students with a variety of formats. I would like to read stories, listen to and sing songs, and also have recordings of authors reading their own stories! With an iPod, I would be able to download these stories and songs to one common playlist, and play them (using the speaker system) during story time. We could then listen to the music and stories while looking at pictures, drawing pictures or even acting the stories out! \n\nStory time is an essential part of the day for every kindergarten student. Giving children access to exciting stories and songs helps encourage a lifelong love of literacy and learning. Enriching those stories with music, pictures, special character voices and illustrations deepens that experience. If you donate to this project, you will be giving very deserving students the tools to make stories come alive, to give them powerful experiences with text, and to develop lifelong readers. "

When I accepted this position, I had just completed teaching for two years in a high school.  Therefore, many of the books that I had collected for my classroom library were not appropriate for middle-school students.\n\nHere's the problem:  I have twenty-eight intelligent students who have the ability to get lost in the incredible world of reading, but many of them think that it is not ""cool"" or ""fun.""  So I got a bright idea.  If I could give the students the freedom to read books of their choice in class, then maybe their interest in books would increase.  I know that, when I was a kid, I hated the books that my teacher MADE me read, but I liked reading on my own time. \n\nSo my students were pretty keen on my idea.  They started reading more, and they seemed to like it more and more each day.  In fact, I have one student who, on the first day of school, told me that he hated reading.  After spending a great deal of time reading books of his choice, he grew to like it.  Before the Christmas holiday, he told me that it is now his favorite thing to do.\n\nI want more stories like this.  The problem is that I don't have much of a library in my classroom.  I tell the students to read, but I don't have many books to offer.  I would like to have books of all kinds.  This way, my students will have plenty to choose from, and they will find books to suit their interests.\n\nI am asking for funding for various books from Barnes and Noble and seven bookshelves from Office Depot.\n"
Laptops For Debate Team III,I want our students to have the same resources as their more wealthy competitors. I want our students to be able to use a laptop for classwork and debates.,"My students need two laptops to compete on the debate team and learn typing skills, research skills, library skills, and reading skills.  ","Our school is located next to a jail where there is a daily line of inmates coming in and out.  On the other side of the street is the criminal courts where there is a daily line of criminal cases.  Our neighborhood is known more for poverty, crime, drugs, gangs, and failing schools than academic opportunities.  However, our school three years ago started a debate team – the only school in the area with a debate team.  It has grown to nearly 100 students from grades 7th-12th, and has become the largest urban debate team in the country.  Our students’ academic abilities range from special education to valedictorian.  Their backgrounds range from abuse, mental institutionalization to perfect attendance.  Their behaviors ranges from regularly suspended to model student.  But they are all united by their passion and love for debating.  They spend their days learning about debate, evenings in debate practice, weekends at debate tournaments and summers at debate camps.  \n	We have become one of the most successful debate teams.  Since our first tournament on October 3rd we have been ranked at least 1st or 2nd every weekend and 1st place at urban debate league tournaments.  We have state champions, city champions, nationally ranked middle school debaters, undefeated debaters, middle school debaters defeating private high school debaters.  You name an accomplishment and chances are our debate team has one under its belt. \n 	For 100 years debate has been dominated by private schools or wealthy, elite public schools. The Urban Debate League was created to provide the opportunity for public school students to compete. While it has created infinite opportunities, the resource inequalities still exist. Our competitors use laptops.  We use scratch paper.  Our competitors wear fancy suits.  Our students wear school uniforms or casual clothes.  Our competitors travel in chartered buses.  We travel on public transportation and discounted bus lines. Our competitors travel around the country.  We can only afford city, local and occasional regional tournaments. We do what we can to raise funds, but the bulk of the money to the support the debate team comes from my own pocket and whatever students can contribute.  But as our team grows larger and stronger, the need for more technology, supplies, tournaments, travel, and coaching grow.  I’ve been told that we should limit the number of students on the debate team but for me that is out of the question.  Every student who is interested and excited about learning should never be denied that opportunity.  Also, I firmly believe that a civics education grounded in debate, public speaking, oratory, politics, current events, law, government, and discussion is desperately needed in today’s schools.\n\nAnd so that is why we turn to Donors Choose to support our Debate Team.  It has been our dream to have laptops for our students.  Our school does not have a computer lab.  Our school had a laptop cart years ago but no longer.  There are no computer skills classes, no typing classes, and no programming classes.  Few students have computer and Internet access at home and the school lacks such resources as well.  That leaves most of the research up to me.  At first while we were building a debate team that was reasonable.  It was hard enough trying to recruit students, train students, encourage them to attend tournaments, and of course trying to win tournaments, while all my students were at the novice high school or middle school level last year.\n\nIn the South Bronx we have an incredible program that is teaching nearly 100 students a year incredible skills in advocacy, public speaking, current events, political science, philosophy, logic, law, government, civics and so many other subjects that are now ignored in our standardized testing world.  Yet our students are learning these skills and subjects that are normally reserved for college.  Our students are traveling across the East coast and even sometimes the entire nation competing in debate tournaments when the majority of their fellow students are stuck on their blocks in the Bronx.  And so I want to make sure if they give me their all, that I give them my all and always guarantee them the best educational resources available.\n\n	Thank you so much for taking the time to read this letter and thanks for supporting Donors Choose.\n\n\n\n"

Our school is unique because we require that all families volunteer 20 hours of their time to the school each year.  With the amount of family involvement we have, we have very few behavior problems, and are really able to focus on education.   \n\nEducation today is much different than in the past.  Kids are so used to instant gratification, with computers, cell phones, and the like, they never have to slow down or wait for anything.  They have everything at their fingertips, and never have to spend time looking for the answers.  Creativity  and imagination are quite rare!  To be successful in the classroom, it requires students to be calm, so they can focus, try new things, make mistakes, and go back and try again; especially in math, science, and writing.  \n\nAfter starting yoga myself 15 months ago, I find I have more patience with my students.  I rarely get frustrated, and find it easier to communicate with my students.  I am a better teacher because yoga has brought balance and peace to my life.  I would like to share this with my students!\n\nI have read many articles about the benefits of yoga for children.  There are tremendous benefits for them, not only physically, but mentally too!

If each of my students had a yoga mat of their own to use, I could incorporate yoga into our daily routine.  Since we live in Arizona, where many days are too hot and polluted to go outside, these mats can be used indoors as well.  They are portable, so we could take them to the park, or playground, or stay inside with them if the weather is not great.  I can use these mats year after year. \n\n \n\nIf I can do this for my students, the possibilities are endless!  You would be providing me with the tools I need to make a different in their lives.  If they are focused and calm, their minds will be open, and ready to absorb all the wonderful stuff that I have to give them.  They will be able to slow down long enough to work through things, and not give up until they have a solution.  Learning is not an instantaneous thing, like most other things today.  Learning takes time and there are usually many failures before success, but students don't have the patience to go through this process.  I strongly believe that this program will change the lives of my students!  I hope you do too!"

We are located on a Special Education Center in California. All of my students suffer from severe communication deficits due to their severe disabilities. During the day, I use different communication techniques including: The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), sign language, pictures and picture words to help promote communication and comprehension. My classroom uses a language-based program to encourage development in communication skills. \n\nMy students will be able to access academic programs through the touch-screen on the tablet. The students will be able to independently select items and answers with their fingers. This alone will bring a great sense of accomplishment, pride, and independence to our students. The students will have access to the tablet during small groups. The students will rotate from one group to the next. For example, one group will work with one tablet during their math lesson (identifying numbers to quantities, identifying and naming colors, shapes. etc). Group 2 will work on their language skills by naming and identifying simple action pictures, naming and identifying letters/words/pre-writing skills. Group 3 will work on self-help skills and art. The students will also have access to the tablet during reading time; stories will be downloaded and read out-loud. There are an infinite number of programs that my students will be able to use with this technology in the classroom. \n\nBy giving my students away to access touch technology in the classroom, you are giving the students independence, pride, and most importantly knowledge in a form that they are able to access in the areas of communication, math, reading and pre-writing skills. By implementing these activities my students will show improvement in academics and comprehension skills. "

Unfortunately, due to our budget restraints, we do not have many books on tape that they can enjoy.\n\nThis is where I think having a listening center organizer with hanging bags, and more books with tapes would be a blessing.  I would use these items to create and organize a listening center.  The students would be able to pick out books and listen to them at the listening center.  This will also help them keep the books in good condition so all the students in the class can enjoy them.  In the past, a few books have been ruined because the students do not have a real place to return the books and tapes when they are finished.  \n\nCan you imagine where you would be if you were not able to read?

Our children do have to deal with certain disadvantages, but we make this a safe, caring, and stimulating environment where we cater to all aspects of the development of our children.  The single most important thing I can do for my students is to help them develop language, the key to their future academic success.  I do this by reading to them at every opportunity and by engaging them in conversations and activities relating to the literature, which we are using.  \n\nI am also able to provide my students with books to share at home to facilitate parent involvement.  We study in thematic units and I have been able to acquire a good deal of quality literature to match these units by receiving mini-grants and participating in Project Read To Me. I am also fortunate to have a volunteer from the Fayetteville Kiwanis who reads to the students several times a year and gives them books to take home.  \n\nAt the moment I lack literature to correspond with themes on special days and holidays.

My students and I come from very diverse ethnic, social, and cultural backgrounds, but we all have one thing in common; we share a thirst for knowledge.\n\nOur program is mostly funded through tuition and receives very little money for classroom supplies, which is why we need your help.  Teaching young children requires ever-changing and challenging activities that will help the children learn and grow.  We have limited supplies, especially items that promote social and fine-motor development.  Puzzles create not only an obstacle to be overcome, but also a goal of completion, and a sense of accomplishment.  In addition, pro-social behavior is developed.

These puzzles include the areas of weather, transportation, literacy, math, geography, diversity, and more.  \n\nTeaching a class with an inquiry-based curriculum is very challenging when the students have a limited knowledge base from which to draw.  The “All About Science Puzzles” set can help concepts come to life for the students.  In addition, children have the choice of either working independently or together using smaller puzzles.  Some children prefer to work separately and show a sense of pride when they accomplish a goal with no help, other children need to have social interaction and affirmation from their teachers or peers throughout the process.  \n\n\nWith your help, and these puzzles, students can become more actively engaged in learning. Puzzles will make learning more meaningful to the children.

Family literacy affects parents' effectiveness in helping their children learn. These are the four components of comprehensive family literacy: (1) interactive literacy activities between parents and children; (2) parent training on how to be their child's first and most important teacher and how to participate in their child's education; (3) literacy training for parents that leads to economic self-sufficiency; and (4) age-appropriate education for children to prepare them for success in school and life. The appeal of family literacy programs as a strategy for educational reform is based on its flexibility (can be adapted to meet the needs of diverse families); its comprehensiveness (two generations educated simultaneously); and its social impact (cycle of poverty and low literacy are broken)."" \n\nOur hope is to provide this family literacy to help our children succeed and build stronger literacy skills.  Books are almost nonexistent in the homes of our children. In order to get books into the hands of parents and to assist parents in working with their children to help the children develop stronger literacy skills, we are proposing the ""Backpack Program"" which provides take-home books and support resources to assist parents in providing the reading support that is so crucial to our high-risk children.\n \nThe dream of the school when it was built was to be a neighborhood school and serve the parents as well as the students. As the Eric Document states, we would like to work with two generations in building literacy and breaking the cycle of poverty through education.\n\nWe have approximately 520 students. Our school is a cooperative venture between CPS and the University of Illinois in Chicago.  Education Majors come from the University to learn more about Urban Education. \n\nWe have opened a parents' room on the first floor that has print resources, computers, and GED and computer classes. The parent room is open five days a week and would be an excellent resource room to use for teaching parents literacy skills to support the education of their children.\n\nOur children do not have computers in their homes and books are very scarce.  Our children love to read and they love books. We want to encourage parents to read to the children to enhance the vocabulary and literacy skills of the children, but need to supply the materials parents need for this to happen. The backpack program would give us materials to use for parent workshops as well as supplying the parents with materials to use at home with their children. These fun backpacks will also build confidence for the parents to work with their children following the instructions and ideas in the backpacks which can be checked out and returned to the school.  The books and material will provide the support help that research shows is so important for our children to become higher-achieving readers.\n\nWe will take pictures of the parent workshops as well as the children using the backpacks. We will also have the students and parents evaluate the backpack program at the end of the semester and share this information with the donor.\n\nThank you for considering this request."

The students in my eighth grade classes are divided homogeneously so I can pace instruction and plan activities geared towards the different ability levels.  The students I want to use the materials with are in my first and second blocks.  These students are eighth grade students that read below grade level.  In my first block, I have 10 EC identified students with learning disabilities in Reading.  I also have 2 English as a Second Language Students.  These students need much practice with reading as it is not valued at home and because they struggle, do not enjoy reading. I love to read and want to instill the love for reading to these students as well.  With the help of these materials, I feel I could increase comprehension and fluency and get these students more comfortable with reading.  \n\nWith the reading resources I have requested, students will be able to obtain more practice reading material that is on their grade level, practice on the computer using the CD-Rom activities, and play games that focus on various types of abstract reading skills.  Students respond to games and technology much better than reading from the literature book or a novel.  ""Tricking"" students into reading by playing games and using technology is a great way to build their reading skills to help develop better readers.  Using the reading comprehension card packet will allow readers to practice reading short passages, practice different comprehension skills and be able to get immediate feedback with the self checking tool.  After practice with these three types of engaging reading comprehension activities, I will develop better readers.  This will result in better reading in all subject areas and allow them to be successful in all they do as a fluent reader. \n\nBecause so many cuts have been made in education (our county still has not been given a budget for instructional supplies for this year!!)

I also feel that book kits that are of high interest to the students will play an important role in allowing the students to become excited about using this tool in the classroom. \n\nMy young first graders will be exposed to books through a listening center. This will aid them at the beginning of the year when they are just learning to read.

Apple's late CEO Steve Jobs wanted to do that exact thing, ""put a ding in the universe!"". \n\nMy students are energetic 1st graders who are eager and full of excitement to learn. They love anything to do with technology and hands on exploration. Our school enjoys using technology and putting these types of tools in the hands of students to enrich their learning. Our school is a low income area and has a rainbow of culturally diverse students.

I want to help my students acquire the skills they need to survive in a complex, highly technological knowledge-based economy.\n \n\niTouch the future . . .iTeach! I want an Apple iPod Touch to supplement my classroom instruction. Students will use iPod applications to practice letter recognition and sounds, sight word recognition, phonics, vocabulary and writing skills. Students will also use a Touch to strengthen math skills. Several students in my classroom do not have access to computers at home. In today's increasingly technology based world, it is essential that students are exposed to a variety of technology so that they can be successful in the future. An iPod Touch could contribute not only to increasing academic progress in my students, but also to exposing them to a new and important technology. I strongly believe that using an iPod Touch will increase student engagement, as well as motivate them to learn.\n\n \n\nThe addition of an iPod Touch in my classroom would greatly benefit the learning styles of many diverse learners. It is intuitive, responsive, and highly motivating. The tactile experience that the device offers means that it will work well with visual and kinesthetic learners. This tool would allow students to take ownership of their own learning and be confident in their education. Your donation will make an immense difference in the lives of the many students it will touch!  "

We need multiple copies of quality literature to make our language arts time the best it can be!  \n\nThe multiple copies of these books including Great Kapok Tree, The True Story of the Three Little Pigs, Tacky the Penguin, and more will be continually read and loved by all second graders. Having the text in hand helps us find text support for building comprehension skills and enhancing with the arts. They are used in both whole and small groups. Often they drive a purpose for a show that we take to first grade and kindergarten to get them excited about quality literature!  \n\nThe multiple copies will help us achieve our goal of inspiring life long readers. The ability to capture a child's interest in reading and to activate their imagination is quite a magical discovery. Motivated learners who are engaged in their learning will be our future leaders!

I am creating interactive notebooks with my students for them to use in class, and when studying to help them understand what is taught. I need your support! \n\nMy students are in a high poverty school. Over 90% of our students receive free or reduced price lunch. It is difficult to get them to school and even harder to get them here with supplies ready to learn. Once they enter my classroom, my focus is on them. Many can not afford the basic supplies to assist their learning. Many of them had me last year and many more did not. They will be learning Geometry and Algebra, preparing for their End Of Course Exam, and I want to give them a study tool that they create. I feel that if they take ownership and pride in their notebook and flash cards, they will be more likely to use them. Every student that I have for the Algebra classes (4 of my 6 classes) have failed their Algebra End Of Course Exam. They really need a new way to look at Algebra. They need tools to help them succeed. They also need patience and guidance from me. Please help them with what I can not give them. \n\nI am creating an interactive notebook and interactive flash cards with my students. They just need the basic supplies. This project is for pens to take their notes and flash cards, markers and highlighters to identify what is most important in their notes and on their flash cards, and a ring to hold their flash cards together so they don't get lost. These resources will give students the tools to take notes and to demonstrate understanding of the material taught. The most important part of the notebook and flash cards is for students to use it. My goal is to teach them the skills to learn, using the tools they have, with the hope that they will pass their End of Course Exams and then go on to college, knowing how to take notes and study in their math classes. Please support us in our learning.  \n\nThese students need the tools to learn and they need to know how to use the tools they are given. I am committed to teaching them the how, but I need your help with the supplies. Please help them with some of the basic needs in the classroom. These students do not have the financial ability to purchase these supplies on their own. Most of them don't arrive with a notebook or index cards, I have to provide them also. I really want to see them succeed and I need your help! "
Living Pictures: Comprehension through Drama,"Students will create 3 Tableaux, in groups of 4-5, and recite aloud sentences they have written to explain their work.

","Remember doing endless workbook pages? Students in my class are now making Tableaux, which help students apply and expand their knowledge and understanding in subjects across the curriculum by asking them to take on the roles of people or objects to create living pictures that we can record. \n\nMy students are sixth graders who love to socialize and be in motion. For them to sit down for more than 30 minutes is a tragedy in their eyes, which is why I'm incorporating more of the Tableaux this year than ever before. By taking concepts they've learned, and creating words and pictures with their bodies, they are more engaged and learning at the same time. Even though I teach at a public school, my students are bussed in from all over the county because we offer a special arts program that includes extra art, orchestra and band, drama, and dance classes. We believe that arts education leads to a well rounded and successful student. \n\nBy having these flip cams I will be handing the students power to create back to them. They are now a part of their learning. To create a Tableau, a living picture, you start off with an idea or theme. We will soon be learning about Ancient China and its inventions. Students will create 3 Tableaux, in groups of 4-5, and recite aloud sentences they have written to explain their work. This verbal part is a summary of skills that they are learning, and I would like to use the flip cam to post these videos to our school website as ""notes"" to review for assessments. Students have done the work now they should be able to benefit from it. By doing the Tableau with nothing to record it, we are unable to analyze areas for improvement or to watch it at the beginning of a lesson for review. I have such a creative class this year, definitely future leaders! We are taking the pen and pencil out of the hands for once and students are in motion. \n\nThe impact of this project for my students isn't just for 1 project, but for the whole year that they have me. We will always do Tableaux, and when children can learn to control themselves in order to create and cooperate in a group they're utilizing future skills that they will need later on in life. They are learning to be creative, and use current technology through their peers if they don't know already. This has so many life applications, that it would be sad to let this opportunity go. "

Many of our students at our elementary school face this issue.  Our school instruments are in a constant state of disarray. \n\nThe students at our school are great!  They are very enthusiastic, hard working, and bright.  In recent years, the school district has received an ""excellent"" rating on Ohio's academic report card, meaning the students at our school have overachieved despite our location and small student attendance.  The band and music programs in our district excel due a supportive community and administration, and very dedicated student musicians. \n\nThe instruments that the school provides for the students are in very, very poor condition.  These instruments are 20-30 years old or older, and many are unplayable.  The current bass drum (pictured) is an old, worn out marching bass drum from the late 1970's.  Not only is it cosmetically damaged, but is a sad representation of what a band program SHOULD have.\n\nBy purchasing this concert bass drum, the band students in the district will be able to learn on a quality instrument.  The bass drum will be used in 5-8th grade concert band, and potentially more after school band activities.  A percussion ensemble is being formed for my most dedicated students and providing quality instruments for them to participate is crucial. \n\nI can see the smile on the students' faces when they see this instrument.  By allowing them to see/hear/play an instrument of this caliber, there is no telling how valuable the experience can be for them.  The arts are so very important to these kids, and all of the students truly love and adore music.  Thank you for your interest in supporting these young musicians! "

Previous gifts have made a tremendous difference and have gotten the kids crazy-excited about learning. Your gift makes a difference and is appreciated! \n\nWe spend a lot of time teaching students about the importance of hand washing, avoiding ""germy"" things, and making good choices when it comes to their health. It makes it kind of ironic when they come into a biology classroom where we deal with things that CAN be harmful and students don't have the ability to wash their hands with warm/hot water and clean lab equipment when they are finished. \n\nMy students deserve to have the opportunity to perform science experiments in a safe environment.  My hope is that you can help me give that to them by supplying us with a small hot water heater that I can easily mount under the sink allowing students to wash hands and equipment so that we don't create an environment that encourages illness.

Not only will they become better readers, they will feel confident in everything they do because they can read!  They will transfer such confidence in themselves to other areas such as math, science, arts, sports, social skills, etc.  They are already falling behind in second grade, please help prepare them for third grade.  I want to see them succeed in second grade and in life, and I know you want to help them, too. "

Deciding to master more than their facts, they have made a commitment to a goal, are dedicated to the practice it requires, and will experience the satisfaction of reaching it! \n\nMy fifth grade students have a joy of learning that is contagious and makes teaching them a joy as well.  They come from a range of diverse backgrounds including second language learners, socio-economic differences, and many affluent family structures as well.  This is a group of students who gets excited about finding as many replacement words as possible for one of our dead words (overused words such as: a lot, good, because) and groan when I have to stop our search and move onto the next activity!  Our school is located in a middle class neighborhood with feeds from several apartment buildings in the area.  It thrives from the support it receives from all its stakeholders.  Our PTA is actively involved in providing all the students with extracurricular programs that our limited budget does not allow.   Parents are willing to give their time and volunteer in the classroom whenever they can.  The teachers are just as willing and care for all students, not just their own class. \n\nAfter taking our beginning of the year math facts tests, the students, as well as I, were dismayed to see how many still had not put those facts to memory.  We looked at our math curriculum, and they noticed (with help from me) how much of it depended on them to know their basic facts.  In our health unit, goal-setting, both short and long term is discussed as an important factor in our daily lives.  Thus came the discussion to set a goal for all to master their facts.  While some student can log onto our school site and practice their facts, not all students have such access.  Many students don't have the home support of practice buddies either.  With the iPads in use in the classroom, those students can be motivated to practice on an app that allows them to select the facts that they don't know and drill and practice with those facts.  The iPads can be used as a reward for practice when timed tests are passed, too.  Keeping track on our mastery board keeps the motivation high! \n\nIf you could see the faces of those students who finally pass a facts test, some of them after many attempts to do so, you would know in a heartbeat how important these donations are.  With technology as a tool for both easier access and motivational purposes, more students are willing to do something that may not be at the top of their list to do.  At the end of the day, the student who has their facts at their fingertips, so to speak, also makes faster progress in more challenging math skills. "

It is very hard, and this leads the children to being fidgety, losing focus and motivation due to the lack of visual stimulation. With this lack of resources, my students are  missing out on a learning moment that could benefit them for a life time! \n\nTo help my students, we urgently need a document camera. With a document camera my children will appreciate read alouds by traveling to the stories' world using their imagination, enhanced by the visuals provided. With the document camera, my children will participate in fun, motivating Shared Reading activities and will engage in the wonders produced by Interactive and Shared Writing. With a document camera, my students can share their own writing to their peers and grow as writers. Thus creating a whole new generation of motivating readers and writers that can inspire future generations. \n\nYou can make it possible for my students by donating a document camera that will enhance their daily learning through motivating images. With the donation of a document camera, my students will appreciate print, images, and illustration as they are on the books that we read everyday. With a document camera, my students will not have to look at photocopied images in black and white and they will be able to see things as their are."
Let's Go: Exploring Our Schoolyard and Beyond,"We can use our eyes and ears to make most of our observations, but some inhabitants of our pond are too small to see. We need some nets to help us safely sample what's in there.",My students need 6 tools and resources to start an ongoing investigation of the pond ecosystem near our school. ,"Help us get out of the classroom! Right behind our school is a lovely pond just waiting to be explored. Not only do we want to observe what lives in the habitat around the pond, we want to know what's living in the pond too. \n\nWe are lucky to have this pond habitat so close to our school. Many of my students come from low income families and have not have many opportunities to get out and explore nature. We have a wonderful nature center in our district, but we only go once during the year.  I would like to use this pond habitat to give them an opportunity to observe what is happening in the habitat over the course of the school year.  Making real life observations and predictions is sure to spark their curiosity. \n\nWe can use our eyes and ears to make most of our observations, but some inhabitants of our pond are too small to see. We need some nets to help us safely sample what's in there. We also need some bug viewers, field guides, and other materials to help identify what we find in our samples. This is what we are asking you help provide for us. \n\n""Come forth into the light of things, let nature be your teacher.""  - William Wordsworth. \n\nHelp me enlist nature to help teach my students the joy of discovery and turn my students on to the mysteries and beauty of nature."

We are struggling to improve our test scores and getting out of school improvement status.  This class is such wonderful, thoughtful group of students who help one another and cheer each other on....and they are in Kindergarten!  They are in love with learning to read and I want their writing skills to grow in the biggest way possible by physically creating their characters, making their ideas come to life right before their eyes. \n\nI am asking for felt to make puppets because we don't have to sew felt, we can glue it.  The students rarely get to experience using clay and the clay I have ordered is easy to mold and can be reused until the student is happy with their project. By physically making their character, the students will be using math skills, planning skills and perseverance.  Completing a multiple-step project is a great lesson for them, one that will help them throughout their education. \n\nThese simple materials can be life changing for a child who might discover a talent for writing, creating characters with words and clay and felt.  You may be helping a child to become the next Jim Henson, Tim Burton or Julie Taymor! "
Listening to Learning!,"These books and CDs are imperative to our classroom.

I read aloud to my students ever day but my students are from different grade levels and want to read the books that their peers in the regular classroom are reading.  However, with the behavior problems and overcrowding in other classrooms my students are not included with the regular classroom.  My school also does not have any extra money to spend so my students do not have a listening center, and most of our books are borrowed from other teachers.  We need these books because my students love reading and ask me everyday when they'll be able to read at their own grade level.

They come from predominantly Latino backgrounds and live in various communities in the Los Angeles area. Most of my students also come from families of low socioeconomic status. Because of this, although they are bright and have great potential, they are often lacking basic supplies.  \n\nI am requesting an LCD Projector. At my school, students are often lacking basic supplies that other schools take for granted. We have to fight tooth and nail to get money for construction paper and markers. Although I can provide some smaller things for my students, I can't provide the money needed for an LCD Projector. I feel that this resource is vitally essential for all students; especially for students who are in the Special Education program. These students are already struggling. Without the visual aids and interactive tools that can be provided with an LCD Projector, these students (and others) fall behind. \n\nMy students have incredible potential and they deserve the same resources and opportunities as students at more affluent schools. The fact that these students go without an LCD Projector is detrimental to their learning and to their future. Please help bring critical technology to my students! "

It is providing more gadgets for people to learn how to use. It is now up to us teachers to try to place this piece of technology into the hands of our students for them to become familiar with and to hopefully use it to help them learn. \n\nThis piece of technology that I am speaking of are the electronic readers that are now available to the American public, specifically the NOOKcolor. This new e-reader from Barnes and Noble will be able to provide opportunities for students to use electronic technology in the classroom. \n\nMy students are growing up in a technologically savvy world. Luckily for them, they have been exposed to technology since they have been able to sit up, from music to the television and then to computers. It is amazing how children these days can easily watch you maneuver around a screen or watch as you push a few buttons and they can repeat these steps easily. \n\nMy students were shown only a few times how to navigate around a much loved website and they were able to go to the areas that they wanted to go to. While it is important for my students to learn how to use technology, it is doubly important to monitor what it is they are doing. \n\nThe NOOKcolor makes it easier for beginner readers to gain the confidence that need to become readers. Children will be able to read along with words on the NOOKcolor with its touchscreen technology. My children may be starting to learn to read and recognize their letters, but they will soon learn to read familiar words that show up. It is giving them the independence and power to show others that they are able to read and work on their own. With just a simple tap, each child controls the story and can jump into an interactive adventure. Expanding text and zooming into pictures makes reading extra fun.\n\nThe case will help protect the NOOKcolor as the children are reading the stories. The ebooks gift card will allow my students to help choose the books that they would like to read. \n\nBy helping to place the NOOKcolor in the hands of my students, you are helping to provide yet another outlet for my students to learn from. Children will be able to listen and follow words as they are highlighted on the screen. Their fine motor skills will also be improved by using their fingers to move around the screen. The NOOKcolor will help my students grow as a whole child. Your donation will be helping to make this happen. "

I teach second grade in a community where the majority of students receive free or reduced lunch. \n\nMany of my students have hand held sharpeners, and we also have a manual sharpener which is not in good condition.  To sharpen an abundance of pencils with this sharpener requires a great deal of time and energy which could best be used elsewhere. \n\nWe need a good quality pencil sharpener that will stand the test of time and will take the daily sharpening of fifty to sixty pencils.  The electric sharpeners purchased in the stores rarely last.  We currently don't have an electric sharpener, but the store-bought ones usually don't last beyond several months. \n\nYour help will ensure that my students are prepared for the day everyday.

The digital camera will also facilitate their social skills; promote good expression, allow their parents to understand the children's educational needs through picture taking so that they can prepare them for college and better future ahead of them.  \nBy looking at the pictures, children can see their emotion and experience on the picture.  It will be a chance for them to express their feelings through writing how they feel and what they did.  This is the precious moment of having children and parents together to look at those pictures.  Furthermore, our society needs to have more parents/children involvement not only to help them to promote good health, but also building loving relationships.  We use this digital camera to capture children's smiles through outdoor/indoor activities, so we can share the picture with the parents about their children in the school.\nGoing out for a field trip outside the classroom is absolutely a fantastic thing to do. Children can explore the outdoor environment by feeling the grass at the playground and touching the sea lives at the aquarium. Parents will love to see their children learning and growing in the moment of going to a field trip.  Teachers can also discuss with the parents about how they give more opportunities for children to learn in all developmental areas. \nAs a teacher, I see students come and go daily. I want to make a special effort to strengthen the bridge between parents, children and staff.

Conclusions can then be drawn pertaining to the ""how's"" and ""why's"" of plant growth. \n\nTechnology is an increasingly necessary tool in today's world at all levels.  Exposing students in career and technical education tthrough chromebooks will provide them with an inexpensive, easy-to-use tool in expanding their scientific knowledge and overall curiosity.

My students love taking blank sheets of paper and stapling them together to create books. Their stories are so creative and imaginative!\n\nMy students, who are capable, will be able to type their stories after they have finished them and print them out. My students with autism flourish when using the computer. They also work much better when using markers and pens than with pencils and crayons. My hope is is that the new supplies will encourage them to have the desire to do more of what their peers are doing.  \n\nWith your generous support, I will be able to update our writing center and give my students an advantage they do not currently have. They supplies we have right now are extremely basic and do not lend themselves to creativity. Please help me provide a higher quality experience for my students.  "

Our students deserve the opportunity to experience the use of mobile technology and how to use a web cam to video link with others and to learn how to put things on the web-sites used by the school.  We are very poor, so we don't have this technology. \n\nWe are a Pre-K - 8th grade school in a very poor area.  The children have many different learning levels and we need many different materials in order to learn.  Technology is the thing of the future, but in the poor district that we live in we don't have many opportunities to get or to use technology.  In order for our children to get and hold a good job they need every ounce of help in their education that we can give them. \n\nThese children will learn how to use this new technology so that they can learn in their own way.  They will be better able to get a good job in the future in many different fields because of it.  They will get to experience things using this technology that they would not have had a chance to otherwise. \n\nThe children have so much fun learning from computers.  They can learn at their own levels this way.  Testing is easier, and they get to experience many different things that happen in today's life in a new way. "
Radical Reading!  ,"I am asking for six different resources.

I CAN read!""  This comment is what I work towards all year with my Kindergarteners.  It is hard to inspire them to start reading when we lack some of the resources that are necessary.   \n\n I am currently teaching Kindergarten to 19 children that are excited about learning. They are very sweet and have a strong desire to learn. I come from a low socio-economic school that lacks support from some of the parents. When some of my students entered Kindergarten, they had never been to preschool and some had never been in an environment with children other than their siblings. Most of my students did not know any letters or numbers, could not write their name, and had never used glue or scissors. \n\nIt is very important for Kindergarteners to have hands-on materials to enrich their learning experience. Their attention spans are not meant to sit on a rug and listen to a lecture. The best way for Kindergarteners to learn is to have interaction with their subject and get involved. The children get so excited and are ready to learn when they have opportunities for hands-on activities.""  \n\nI am asking for six different resources. These sources include a word pattern learning center, beginning blends and digraph center, middle sound center, rhyming center, a picture-word match, and newsprint paper. If the children had these learning centers, they would have so much fun learning phonics. The children would get excited about learning and would aspire to do better.\n\nI have found that when the students get excited about learning, they learn even more. These resources would be a wonderful edition and would be used everyday. The skill levels range, so it would benefit every student, from my lowest to highest. It would be a “dream come true” for my students to have the opportunity to use these valuable resources.  \n\nIf you help our classroom, you will be changing the life of 19 wonderful children and countless others in the future. Kindergarten is a vital year. This is the year that a child’s educational foundation is set for their entire academic future. You could truly make a difference and help these children build a strong foundation that leads them to success in the future.\n\nPlease open your heart up to these children, so they can learn how to read. That is a gift that will stay with them forever! "
"The King of Knox, Pawned to the Students",Problem solving skills are a necessity for middle school students and chess will begin to grow those skills.,"My students need a complete set of chess sets, boards and clocks to improve their problem solving skills. ","Many of my students have expressed interest in the game and have asked if there will be a chess club. Many of the 6th graders need an extra curricular activity and they are not permitted to participate in sports. This will give many of them an outlet. \n\nI work at a high poverty, high needs school in North Carolina. Most have a desire to learn about chess, and have never had the opportunity to be exposed to it. Many struggle academically with problem solving specifically. Chess will aid their problem solving skills as well as begin to stretch their perspective on what they are capable of. \n\nMany of these students have never considered chess. Many find it an interesting activity and are willing to learn it. My desire is to start a chess club and train the students enough to be able to compete against other schools in our district. Problem solving skills are a necessity for middle school students and chess will begin to grow those skills. \n\nOur schools continue to suffer from the lack of finances to the detriment of our students. This project will provide the needed chess resources to provide my needy students with access to quality chess equipment they would otherwise not have access to. I long to see the improvement of their problem solving skills after a year of chess involvement. Thank you for your help to benefit my students. "

Obtaining good science and safety equipment is top on my list. \n\nMy students can learn more by working chemistry labs with appropriate glassware.  Over the years, glassware has been broken and not replaced as needed to keep our lab a supplied functioning lab.  I'm gradually trying to add glassware to my classroom so that all students will have access to equipment and be able to participate in labs. \n\nMy students sometimes feel like second class students when we try to do labs with very equipment that is very limited and, in some cases, in very bad shape.  Having plenty of new, clean equipment gives the students a sense of having a more ""normal"" classroom.  The excitement that comes with the arrival of new equipment is always something the students look forward to. "

Instant Gratification,"The best educational tools can greatly improve classroom instruction.

A document camera is a valuable tool that should be available to students.",My students need a document camera.,"Grant is a large comprehensive high school in Portland, Oregon. I primarily teach world history to freshmen but I also teach psychology to the upper class students.\n\nI never felt that using a document camera in class would provide much of a benefit. That is until last year when I was provided temporary access to one through a struggling readers grant. I reluctantly used it in class and found that it was the single most valuable tool I had for providing students with immediate gratification for showing their exceptional efforts as well as being able to share those same works with others via the web.\n\nThere are three primary classroom uses of a document camera that makes it a very valuable  tool. One is that it allows student work to be displayed as an example in an instant, which provides instant gratification. Students then begin to compete for the honor to get their work shown and as a result, work quality throughout the class improves. \n\nSecond, it provides an easy method to show student work on classroom blogs and websites. Without the document camera the process is much more difficult and as a result the student work less likely to be displayed.\n\nThird, procedures that are very detailed can very easily be displayed through the use of a document camera. The teacher can perform the procedure under the document camera lens and all the students in the class can easily see exactly how to perform the task. When I say ""I need it to look like this"" every student can see what ""this"" is through the use of the document camera.\n\nThe best educational tools can greatly improve classroom instruction.

I need to maintain their motivation for learning in more than one way as student have different methods of understanding.  Every student has a different learning modality and requires different means of communication such as diagrams, movement, oral, or visual examples to understand the concept. I would like to have the white boards be a tool they can manipulate to explain their reasoning and understanding of the Spanish language without stepping out of their comfort level. \n \n\nThe white boards will be used by the students to allow them to demonstrate their understanding of Spanish that can light up their eyes and make learning fun. My students have the ability to become the next engineer, doctor, or teacher of California that is inspired by what can be done with learning a second language such as Spanish. \nThere are Spanish words that can be shown with color, shapes, or object that are difficult to describe with a text book. Spanish is best learned when observed and demonstrated both orally and visually. White boards allow the student to have artistic opportunity to demonstrate language for the rest of the class to see. Students can fulfill foreign language requirements with more comfort in their demonstration ability by writing, drawing, or reading Spanish with their white boards. Students can take their Spanish language skills to a future employment opportunity in the Bay Area region; where employers are more likely to hire an employee that is bilingual. \n\nDonors,\nI make a simple request of a white boards, pens, and eraser for CHS students of disadvantage backgrounds, who need inspiration from beyond the school walls. Students have limited supplies and no support outside of school that inspire them to go outside of their “normal” lives.

Students will be able to use critical thinking skills to analyze the author's perspective and viewpoint toward immigration. By the end of the unit, they will learn how to present an effective argument by writing a persuasive essay on the ideas presented. This essay will also include a portion where they will conduct research on the topic. They will be able to understand and respect viewpoints that are different from their own. I am working with the Urrea's publicity manager for an opportunity for him to visit with the students at school. This will be a question and answer session that will give students the opportunity interact with the author. If this is not possible, students will meet him at a local book festival that is held at the beginning of next year. \n\nAlthough classics such as The Scarlett Letter are available through the school, there are few books that touch on topics that are present in our everyday lives.

It serves a large number of economically disadvantages families mostly due to its high number of just arriving immigrant children.  However, despite having so many economically disadvantaged students, we maintain the highest standards. Unfortunately the students still scoring the lowest on standards are the economically disadvantaged and the English language learners. My students are typical English language learners struggling to learn a new language and fit into a new society.  For some it is an easier struggle because of their particular educational and/or cultural background.  But for many, who do not even master their own home language due to poor educational experiences or coming from a radically different culture, the task of learning a new language and/or way of living is daunting. Nevertheless, they are like children everywhere wishing to do well and fit into their environment. \n\nThese resources will be used in the classroom as additional reading materials.  All About the USA 3: A Cultural Reader will provide the opportunity to read and learn about things they have never heard about or do not understand the history behind them. It will provide them with vocabulary that fits into the daily life of their new country.  They will use these readings as a basis for project based activities that will enable them to compare and contrast the history and culture of the United States with their own, as well as those of other countries. \n\nThe donations will improve my classroom by providing reading material that is relevant and eye opening to English language learners and will allow them to better understand their new country.

Such a relevant and real-time experience lends itself to any grade level and can be used to varying degrees of complexity as the school year goes on. \n\nFor example, we can start by making a simple object with the MakerBot and then eventually create a multi-piece project!  \n\nTechnology can act as a barrier or bridge to a successful life.

What did I get on my test?!"" ""Miss! Did you talk to my Grandma yet?"" ""Miss! I need that form!"" ""Miss! Someone stole my backpack and it had my project in it!"" Middle schoolers in general are not known for their well developed organizational skills and teaching 120 of them can get crazy! \n\n90% of my students are Hispanic and a majority of them come from homes where English is not the language spoken at home. 96% of our students receive free lunch. They are 12, 13, 14 years old and they are wonderful! However, they are not very organized! At our school we strive to provide students with a high quality education that is rigorous, engaging, and will help our students to be competitive and successful. Each hour, minute, and second is critical to their success. Spending time handing out papers in class and getting students prepared with the materials they need is a sure way to waste precious time, time that could be better spent giving students feedback, conducting a quick mini-lesson, or asking about a student's new baby sister! \n\nI teach 100-120 students every day. While we teach them skills to be successful, every support we can give them when it comes to academics, character building, and organization is essential. These mailboxes will transform the daily housekeeping of the classroom as well as invest students more in their own success. Students will have a ""home"" in the classroom, they can take ownership and responsibility for having their materials for class, and teachers and students can communicate easily. \n\nMy goal is to always teach for deep understanding and for students to create personal meaning out of our curriculum. They do lots of projects where they imagine themselves in important roles - city planners, cartographers, peace activists - projects that they come back to over multiple days. Having a place to store this careful, thoughtful work will help to organize and show respect for the good thinking we do in class every day! \n\nGetting these mailboxes will help twelve and thirteen year old students be successful! These are critical years where good habits are being formed and the more we can do to show kids that we support them, care about them, and that they each have a place in the class, the more school will feel like a place that serves them and that they are a part of.

My students, who happen to have profound cognitive and physical disabilities, attend a separate school due to the severity of their disabilities. Most of our students come from low-income families. Despite the challenges our students face, they are very energetic and well-spirited kids. \n\nThe Music & Movement: Nutrition in Action! Curriculum will be perfect for teaching my students about fitness and healthy eating habits.  Since my students have special needs, they learn in special ways.  The best way to motivate, teach, and ensure my students participate, is with music.  This curriculum will educate my students on the importance of being active and eating well while entertaining them.  We can incorporate this into a year round curriculum that we use three times a week! \n\nEating right and exercise are important for to ensure long healthy lives.  My students' health is already at a disadvantage due to their physical, mental, and medical disabilities.  By providing me with these learning materials, you will be providing me with the change to improve my students' lives.  We really appreciate your consideration. "

They are beginning this work by planting seeds in self-watering containers and placing them in strategic locations around the school. This will work with our spring and summer months but fall and winter are not good times of the year to work with plants in our geographic area. \n\nThe next step of our proposal is to obtain two GrowLab Maximum Light 3-Tier Gardens. By using this device we will continue to grow plants through the winter months, reminding our students that combating global warming is not a one-shot deal but must be sustained to have an impact. By tending the plants all winter, the students will have an abundance to add to our school's ""green"" environment, and to share with the neighborhood as a beautification process. Being an inner-city school there is no room on the school grounds to plant a garden, and a greenhouse outside the building is not practical. This Light Garden will keep the concept of acting locally right before the children. \n\nOnce we get started with our local plan to ""green"" up the school, I want the students to be able to continue and expand their efforts. The Maximum Light Garden uses glare-free full-spectrum fluorescent bulbs so plants grow faster and fuller. As the 6th grade students study Earth Systems they can relate what they are studying to current events and to what they are doing to help sustain the Earth. In this way, their education is linked from year to year and they see the connection to school work and to the real world."

Great Books Deserve Stronger Shelves,"Have you heard of the ""Broken Windows Theory""?

It suggests that areas that vandalized, and in disrepair bring about low expectations and perpetuate a climate of failure. I want to show my students that they DESERVE a beautiful place to read and learn.  \n\nI teach 8th Grade English in a high-crime, high-need area of a major metropolitan area. We are a small charter school with a mission to prepare our students for college and motivate them to adopt and nurture that mission all the way through college graduation. After which, they can become leaders in their own neighborhoods to affect badly needed change.\n\nIn order to accomplish our mission, we are constantly working to show our students we believe in their ability to succeed and that they can overcome the overwhelming obstacles in their lives.\n\nUnfortunately, our building does not communicate success. We are fortunate to have a parent association of wonderful families that volunteer to clean and beautify the school, but they have limited resources. Also, due to national and state budget cuts, the school itself has little money for beautification.\n\nBetween the broken book shelves and stained carpets, it becomes harder and harder to emphasize the value of education.  \n\nMy students' favorite part of class is independent reading. I have gathered some mismatched chairs, a few bean bags, old couch cushions, and rugs to make my room a cozy spot to curl up with a book. I have done my best with limited resources, covering old cushions with discount fabric, painting chairs with leftover pain to hide the scratches and chips, and cleaning my own classroom to make sure that students don't feel like they aren't ""good enough"" to have a nice school.\n\nEven with all the work I've put in, the materials I've gathered, which were cheap to begin with, are worn out and shoddy looking. I am dedicated to spending time this summer collecting new furniture and rugs, painting the walls in my room, and repairing everything that is broken. There is so much darkness in my students' lives, I want them to have a bright beautiful spot that they connect to learning. Hopefully, the positive environment will help further our positive message about growth and learning.  \n\nI know that I am only asking for some shelves in this project, and that probably doesn't seem like a big deal, but combined with other work that I'm doing, these solid, durable shelves will transform the appearance of our classroom. Right now we have shelves beyond repair, being held by cinder blocks and they are still bowing. Please help improve the quality of our learning!  "

The majority of families in our community immigrated to the U.S. within the last five years.  These families have brought with them a world of agricultural knowledge. Because of many socioeconomic challenges, our students have little access to healthy or fresh food options.  Additionally, our high school is known for having a poor reputation.  Students see the school farm as a unique quality that challenges negative stereotypes of our school.  With the support of the high school and the community, the students are encouraged to learn how to grow and prepare their own healthy food. Their new skills and enthusiasm, combined with their family's agricultural knowledge, create a healthier community one seed at a time. \n\nWe need these tools to properly care for our orchard.  The trees were donated to the school farm and the school does not have the funds to support a new set of tools for tree care.  For this reason, the program has been supported by used donated tools for the past several years.  This has created challenges for our students and for our trees.  Our hope for your donation stretches beyond our school farm and into the backyards of our community, allowing us to plant a healthy future. The grafting kit that we requested allows us to take the scions pruned from our trees and graft new trees for students to take home.

Unfortunately, they are below grade level and I need to be able to show them how to write using the writing process. \n\nOver the years, I have learned that color paper helps the students learn the writing process. For example: The yellow paper is for prewriting, green is used for rough drafts, blue is for the revising, pink is for proofreading, and when we publish our work by typing it on the computer. The student colored paper matches the teacher's modeling and displayed examples. \nI have communicators and students can place the colored paper inside each pocket. Students will use dry eraser markers during conferences with peer and the teacher to write suggestions and comments. We also will cut the colored paper into four squares to offered suggestions/comments for each step of the writing process. More importantly, the corrections written on the plastic cover give the students ownership since their original paper remains intact.  \n\nStudents need to learn that writing is a process to express themselves. Through modeling, grouping, team, and independent practice students will learn how to engage their audience. Also, students learn how to offer and receive suggestions through conferencing. \nStudents have to learn how to build stamina for writing and how they can improve their writing. Next, breaking lessons into manageable steps will help build comprehension, writing fluency, and reflection when communicating with an audience. Lastly, this project will help me assist my students reach their learning objective that was established for my grade level."

These students have struggled their whole lives due to learning disabilities, medical problems, family issues, lack of support, motivation and access to materials. 60% of the students receive free and reduced lunches and many come from broken homes. Our district is somewhat transient, as we are on the edge of a larger city and students come and go and come back again all through the year. This makes learning very difficult and often students are playing catch up in their classes. When students come to my class they are often unmotivated and have mastered ""fake reading"" tactics in attempt to fly under the radar. Many of the 8th graders have been in my class before and I am constantly changing and modifying my curriculum to meet my unique students' needs. I love working with these students because they have so much potential to shine and just want someone to believe in them. \n\nThrough a grant, our school will be reading Wonder by RJ Palacio for One Book, One School next year. This will be done in students' regular ELA classes. Since I am not their regular classroom teacher, I am not reading Wonder with my students. I still want to integrate and encourage the ""Choose Kind"" message of Wonder through literacy.\nThese five titles have themes that are parallel with Wonder - friendship, being different, accepting others, and kindness. We will read these books during a 6 week literature circle book study, and focus on reading skills, team work and deep discussions about books and life. This will in turn be 1. a stepping stone to fostering meaningful reading lives for my students and 2. helping them be kinder young adults and more accepting of others. \n\nGoing through middle school is tough, but reading about kids that have gone through the same problems you have makes life's ups and downs a little more understandable.

This will allow students to be engaged independently during small group instruction. While I am working with small groups, a group of students will have the opportunity to listen to a fun and creative book or activity on CD.  This will give students the opportunity to be exposed to many different forms of print.\n\nListening to books on CD will enable my students to build fluency and comprehension skills. Not only will it help my students' listening skills but also help them with phonics and phonemic awareness. \n\nMy students really want to learn, but we often lack the resources. They deserve only the best quality of education and learning environment. These books on CD will allow my struggling readers to overcome their difficulties with reading and, most importantly, make learning fun! "

Students will get the materials they need quicker with less delay.\n\nThe Xerox machine will also be utilized as a shared resource with other teachers in my grade level. It's no secret that one of the greatest challenges educators face is lack of time. Teachers are under a lot off pressure to meet the high demands put on them. This will reduce some of that pressure.\n"

Unfortunately, with all the recent layoffs and closing of mines, the students come from families who are desperately trying to make ends meet. They live from payday to payday. The morale of my students and the community is down. Many of my students get away from all the stress of home when they come to school. Art is a way that they can show creativity and express themselves. My students are willing to try anything that I suggest to them and most of the time they can do it better than I can! I work in a PreK-8th school. I would love to provide new art supplies for my students when they return to school in the fall. \n\nI see all of the students in my school every week, some even come 3 times a week.  We go through lots of supplies. I have requested crayons, colored pencils, canvas and paints. We will use the requested supplies for our art projects.  My students are very creative and I would love for them to be able to express themselves through their art.   \n\nDonations for this project will improve my students' art projects.  When students have new materials to use they are happy.  Happy students tend to create better projects and they seem to enjoy it more. Donations will benefit every student in my school. "
Mathtastic!,My kids love centers because it gives them a sense of mastery of the materials and a way to connect with their teacher in a small group.

It's mathtastic because it is fun! \n\n I am constantly impressed by the knowledge my students bring into the classroom from their lives outside of school. They deserve the best and the opportunity to experiment and explore with math tools. For many of these students, school is the only stable environment they are exposed to. The more I can show them they deserve the best, the more they will believe they can do their best and succeed. Yay for fun times with math! "
"Head""ing in the Right Direction",I am requesting headphones for the students in my classroom. We have 12 computers and 22 students that cannot use these computers to their full potential because we have no headphones.,My students need headphones and adapters to use while working on the computers in our classroom.,"Have you ever wanted to listen to something on the computer but you couldn't because you had no headphones and there were 24 other people in the room? That is the challenge we face in our eMINTS classroom. \n\nMy students attend a high poverty, inner city Midwest school. Their desire to learn is contagious and everyday they express this with their words and actions. In our classroom, we were given the funding for 12 computers to use with the eMINTS (www.emints.org for more info.) program. This special program allows students to use computers as an aid in their learning in ways that might not be possible at other schools. \n\nI am requesting headphones for the students in my classroom. We have 12 computers and 22 students that cannot use these computers to their full potential because we have no headphones. If we receive these headphones, students will be able to collect information or complete a WebQuest in not only science and social studies, but math and reading, too! \n\nAs of now, students can only complete basic research on the Internet for their projects. If they run into a video that they believe is important to their research or are listening to a story during reading they would not be able to watch it because it would be distracting for others. Your help will allow students to reach the next step in their learning and add an element that is currently not there. "
Reading Creates Readers,"My students do not read, they are linguistically impoverished (thirty-two millions words behind their peers).

This donation will purchase the top recommended books for young adult readers.,"I have never read a book and you can't make me!"" responded one student as he entered my reading class. My reply was ""You just haven't found that special book that is so good you will beg for more time to read it!"" That is what this donation will provide for my reluctant high school readers! \n\nI teach high school students who are reading below grade level. These students, for various reasons, do not see themselves as readers. My job is to change their negative talk they have about reading. I need to get these reluctant readers reading at a level that will allow them choices after high school. Choices like trade school or college! To do that, I need to get these students reading more than short stories in a textbook. Our budgets in Idaho have been cut, this year we have zero money to spend in our classroom. I need to get books into these students hands, books that will grab their attention from page one! Many of my students dislike going to the library, to them, it is like  being told what to read. If I had a classroom library of highly engaging books, students will feel they have a choice which will help with their desire to read. Reading creates readers! \n\nAmong seventeen-year-olds, the percentage of nonreaders has more than doubled over a twenty-year period. On average, Americans ages 15-24 spend almost two hours a day watching television, and only seven minutes of their leisure time on reading. My students do not read, they are linguistically impoverished (thirty-two millions words behind their peers). I need to get interesting reading materials into these reluctant teens hands and inspire them to become readers! There is something magical that happens when a teen finds that book that grabs their attention from page one and they can't put it down! This grant would create a book flood zone in my classroom. The amount of time a student reads out of school strongly relates to reading achievement levels. I can't wait to have these books ready to offer my students because I believe it will change their lives. Students will journal daily about their book, create a project and then present it to the class. \n\nMy students need a chance to read two books at a time: one that requires me, the teacher, to be in the room, and one that is a high-interest, fun read. Ignoring the recreational side of reading is a recipe for ""readicide."" I believe both sides of reading-the academic and the recreational- need extensive emphasis. With these high interest books in their hands, they will experience the joy of reading and  become life long readers with a reading ability that allows them choices after graduation! "

To be able to see tools used for cooking and cleaning during colonial times, or to touch a beaver skin really helps students understand and appreciate history. \n\nOur 4th grade students love to learn about American History and although our textbooks are fairly new, they cannot take the place of an expert standing in front of them answering all the questions that they may have.  Most of our students come from various ethnic backgrounds and so American history is somewhat foreign to them.  But this does not stop their quest for learning, in fact, they are intrigued by the early american settlers and love to compare life styles. \n\nIn the past, we have been able to have a teaching artist but funding for the arts has been drastically cut over the years.  This project is an extremely valuable one.  It combines history and art in a way that brings both subjects to life.  The teaching artist will show students artifacts from the NY Historical Society and then will show the students how to draw those artifacts using the techniques of shading and coloring.  This is a skill that our students would not be exposed to as we do not have an art teacher in our school.  This project will inspire all four classes to understand that history can be fun. \n\nReading historical facts and figures in text books can be rather dull.  This program brings history to life.  The students can hold artifacts in their hands sparking questions and theories that would normally never come up.  To be able to then produce a piece of art from this experience is something that each student never forgets.  Please help fund this program to keep the spark of history alive. "

We primarily serve students that identify as African American, Latino, Asian and Pacific Islander.  The students are also primarily from low-income neighborhoods. \n\nThe more I get to know my third graders, the more I realize they live in a world they don't understand.  The concept of time (days, months, years, decades) is really challenging for these young scholars to understand, yet it is critical for studying history.  We need access to materials that make time more concrete.\n\nThey also don't have access to historical literature that is relevant to THEIR cultures.  I would like to change this!  I strongly believe that these students deserve to learn about how African Americans, Latinos, Asians, and Pacific Islanders have shaped our world.  I believe this will empower these young scholars to want to shape their world today. \n\nThese materials will be used in a variety of ways to make history and time come alive for my third graders.  We will use some of the literature as read alouds to explore the history from the perspective of African Americans, Latinos, Asians, etc.  These perspectives are not often presented in standard social studies textbooks, and I believe they need to be heard.  \n\nWe will feature some of the literature in our classroom library for the students to access during our non-fiction reading units.  \n\nWe will utilize the timeline paper to create a shared timeline of the students' families birth years, to make the passage of time more relevant to the students.  Then, we will add important historical dates to the timeline as we read different historical texts.  \n\nWe will use the math-focused books in order to connect history and time and to empower students in understanding where numbers come from and how that connects to their cultures.\n \n\nI know even as an adult I struggle to understand history and to have a deep understanding of time, how cool would it be to give these young scholars a chance to delve deeply into an exploration of their own history?  It is my hope that this exploration will inspire their future. "

I teach in a third grade classroom and the boys and girls are in need of personal space when we gather on the rug.  They love the idea of getting to sit somewhere besides their desks all day long.  They would do every bit of their classwork on the rug if they could.  Unfortunately, some of the children have to sit near the rug and not actually on it. \n\nThe rug that I am requesting is a gray 9x12 rug from Lakeshore learning.  This is the perfect size for the number of children in my class.  I chose the gray because I felt that it would be the most versatile color choice.  Because our entire classroom has tile flooring, it would be nice to have a soft place for the children to sit when we are gathered together.    \n\nI have tried extremely hard to make my classroom an inviting space, but I don't think that the children feel very welcome on the rug.

Over 80% of my students receive free/reduced lunch, and the majority of first graders begin the year below the fall reading benchmarks.

Having a dedicated time each day for reading from their book box of just-right books is a critical piece of becoming a confident and independent reader. At this time of year (March) students read independently for at least 30 minutes each day. Their frequent inability to stay in one spot is sometimes the largest barrier to their reading progress. Instead of repeating, ""Stay in your spot,"" ""Save that to show your reading partner,"" ""I'm reading with someone else right now,"" ""You JUST went to the bathroom,"" ad nauseam, I want them to be excited about staying in their reading spot during independent reading time. Our school uses the Teachers' College Reading Workshop, which emphasizes the importance of reading ""long and strong"" every day. Building this reading stamina is a challenge! Their reading pillows and colorful (and durable!) book boxes will transform their independent reading time! \n\nWhen students are able to make the most of their independent reading time, they FLY. First grade is a critical year for learning to read, and these reading tools will help them become literate and confident citizens. "

Desks take up a lot of space in a small portable so I would like to create new centers with space saving in mind. \n\nMy idea is to have a math listening center that has enough materials for 4 children to work at once…with all the cards and manipulatives they need to complete 4 different activities. I found a small space saving table for 2-4 students with a designated area for a portable CD player, jacks and a storage compartment for the math CD's and cassettes I've included in the project.\nMy students would have there own area to work in that would stay organized and have all the math manipulatives and CD's at their fingertips. Organization and transitions are vital for special needs students.\n \n\nPlease consider helping me create this space saving math area for my students. It will give them a place to work on listening and following directions skills in a fun, hands-on way that promotes independence."

","Do you remember the days of chalk and blackboards, film strips and movie projectors?  Today's technology makes learning come alive in ways I never imagined as a young school girl . . . but only when the classroom has the equipment it needs. \n\nMy second graders are a diverse group of curious, engaged learners attending a school with high expectations for learning. They grow as writers when they can see good writing modeled and projected on a whiteboard, as mathematicians when they see problems modeled and solved.  Educational videos and PowerPoint presentations make learning in science come alive.  But all these opportunities for learning depend on a projector. \n\nWith a multimedia projector, I can utilize the technology provided by a laptop, document camera, and iPad to enhance and deepen my students' learning on a daily basis.  The students in my class can be exposed to so many different learning experiences just through this one piece of equipment. \n\nHelp me move my classroom from ""old school"" to the 21st century by donating toward a multimedia projector. A projector is the key to bringing modern technology and all its benefits into my classroom on a daily basis. "

The pedometers make it fun to move!,"Motivating the students to move is not always an easy thing to do in physical education.  Using a hands free counting device gets even the reluctant child to see how many steps they can do and break their own record the next week.  The kids love pedometers! \n\nI teach first through fifth grade physical education to all the students once a week.  The children at the school are very excited to see me and work very hard to improve their physical skills.  We discuss the importance of nutrition and exercise in living a healthy lifestyle.  I develop games based on the P.E. standards so the learning concepts are memorable and used at home.  This school has a strong parent and community connection which supports my focus on wellness beyond school.  My fellow teachers also help keep the children active and stress the importance of taking care of yourself.   \n\nPedometers are exciting for the children as they see immediate results.  We have used the pedometers in the past to make a kickball game active so no one is just standing around.  Instead, the outfield are all wearing pedometers and trying to get 500 steps so they can switch with the kicking team.  It looks like a dancing game!  Pedometers help the children experience how many steps are needed to burn calories, have a healthy lifestyle and can be used to work on math skills and goal setting.   \n\nMany of the children ask why we no longer use our old pedometers.  Unfortunately the batteries are out and replacing them cost as much as new pedometers.  Pedometers use technology to inspire movement and would improve my classroom by showing the children a simple yet fun way to exercise.  In addition, pedometers can be used by anyone and are an experience that would promote a healthy lifestyle. "

Budding journalists need access to technology to start an online news source for our school and community. \n\nOur students are resilient young writers who attend an under-resourced school in California.  They are advanced Juniors who have decided to commit to pioneering AP English Language and Composition class and founding a school online news source. They love arguing, writing, and have taken it upon themselves to be role models for the lower grades. They are representative of our school as a whole--about one half are English Language Learners, and nearly all qualify for free or reduced lunch.\n\nOur students want to create a forum and online news source to document the happenings in our community and spur civic engagement.  Unlike other nearby schools, our students do not have consistent access to technology.  Our school does not have a functioning computer lab, so our students lack the exposure to 21st century media skills. \n\nThe three netbooks will create a mini-journalism workstation that students can use to establish an online news site for our school.  Students can use the computers to publish their work in a ""blog"" setting--including original articles, videos, photographs, slideshows, and infographics.  They can peruse existing online media for inspiration.  \n\nMost importantly, the access to technology in the classroom will help students gain fluency in 21st century skills.  They will have a chance to write professional emails, to complete Internet research, to judge the veracity of online sources, and to use social networks and online platforms to tell their own stories. \n\nHelp our students to see themselves as journalists.  Access to these netbooks will inspire students to report, interview, write, rewrite, and publish.  If we can put the tools in students' hands, they can create a forum for our entire school community.

Kids who are picked up by their stay-at-home parents to students who rarely see their parents because they work all the time.  I have students whose parents take them to the library weekly and spend several hours a week reading to them.  Unfortunately, I also have students who do not have any sort of books at all in their own homes.  This needs to be changed!  One way that I change that is by having my students participate in a reading challenge. \n\nAre you interested yet?  The challenge is quite simple.  The students in my classroom are challenged to read over 25,000 miles before I read 5,000 miles Across America.  I'm sure you have another question:  how does a person read across America?  Again, quite simple.  Each page of a book that is read is equal to one mile!  The students' have reading logs that they keep track of the pages that they've read out of books, magazines, basically anything that they get their hands on to read.  For each 100 pages they read, they earn a plane that tells them how far they have traveled.  I read, have a reading log, and earn a car for every 100 pages I read as well.  For each child who reads over 1,000 miles, they earn a free book from several classics that I have chosen such as Green Eggs and Ham, The Tale of Despereaux, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid.  I choose books that I know the kids are already excited about, plus books that are timeless classics. \n\nI need your help in order to ensure that my students are excited about reading.  It would be fantastic to have the books visible for the students so they can have an idea of what book they would like to read for.  I love this time of year because the kids really do become excited and invested in a cause: to beat their teacher!  I create a bulletin board that is posted right outside our door so that everyone in the school knows how my students are doing.  Please help make this the best year yet! "

The majority of these students live in poverty and are on free or reduced lunch, but they come to school each day, excited and eager to learn. I want to make sure that I can provide them with all the resources that they need to be successful in the classroom. \n\nAs I enter my third year of teaching, not only am I thinking about how I can make my lessons even more engaging that the last year, but I am also thinking about all the supplies that I ran out of at the end of last year and what I need to re-stock my classroom in preparation for the upcoming school year.  \n\nFor example, glue sticks were used a lot by my students for various craft activities, and wet erase markers gave each student the opportunity to participate in hands-on answering of science questions on my makeshift whiteboards (and they could be easily erased with a little bit of water and used over and over again!)  I always took pictures and videos of my students in action whenever we were doing a lab or activity. Throughout the course of the year, I also frequently used little treats to reward positive behavior and good work. \n\nThese may seem like very trivial requests, but they are items that I am running low on, and that I know from my past two years of teaching experience that I need in order to continue doing the same activities.

The emails, texting,smart phones; you name it the distractions are there. Our Algebra I pacing is tough and daily direct instruction is brutal. I want to use interactive technology for support, remediation and as a creative outlet in math. \n\nMy 8th graders come from throughout our large school district in Northern California. They are diverse in home language, race, socioeconomic level, math proficiency and special needs.  All of them are in Algebra I. More than half of them have a support class with me. Even with the support class the amount of material that needs to be taught and mastered is, for many, monumental. Many of my students who were normally proficient in math have found that they are struggling to maintain a comfortable of level of understanding in Algebra.  \n\nI have students who have struggled in math since they entered middle school. They face an uphill battle with retrieving their past math knowledge and applying it to the new Algebra I standards.  We do not have a regular lab time and many students do not have access to technology and have not been able to take advantage of the applications available to practice and create. \n\nThe tablet PC offers both the remediation applications along with creative technological capabilities. I have my students work in groups. My stations now include working with white boards, with my one student computer, with review sheets and with posters. A station with a tablet PC could be used not only for interactive review and remediation but also to create projects with available software.\n\nOur 8th graders are required to complete an electronic presentation of a couple of word problems; with the tablet PCs camera and sound capabilities I can offer them the chance to work together and create their own math music video to help themselves and their peers.\n\nI am always available after school and now I would have the hardware for those who do not have access to it at home.  I look forward to opening up the minds of my students to the opportunities in math and science that are not just static books but dynamic applications using a tablet PC. \n\nNext year my students will go on to different high schools.  Most will move up to geometry and some will repeat Algebra. Many of my former students come by and tell me that high school is not so bad. They tell me that the hard work of mastering the math individually coupled with the group work reinforced their understanding of Algebra. I always ask what I can do to improve. To summarize their thoughts, as technology advances, I should incorporate more technology in the group work. "

I'm constantly telling my students that history and social studies are all around them and can be seen in their day-to-lives, whether that be in the food they eat or the games they play with their families. \n\nMy students live in a community that is struggling to pull itself up by the bootstraps. Our town was listed on Forbes ""Fastest Dying Cities"" list and featured on 60 Minutes because of the effect of the recession on the local economy. As someone who grew up here and returned after college to teach, it was tough to take because this community and these kids have so much to offer. My hope is that I can inspire my students to be proud of what we have here and to be a part of the solution which restores our community to what it once was and what we all know it can be. \n\nSettlers of Catan is a game that allows players to build towns, cities, and trade networks to grow their civilization and dominate their rivals. The board is made up of resource tiles like wheat and ore that can be used to build your civilization or for trading with others. In order to win, you must build the most powerful civilization. It's all fun and games with some excellent parallels to history and economics.\nStudents must understand the role geography and access to natural resources have had on the formation of world civilizations. In the game, some resources are better than others and the players with access to those resources generally have an advantage. This is true in history as well, with many of the world's most powerful civilizations being the ones with abundant resources. \nThe game also does a nice job of introducing the concept of supply and demand. Players must trade to acquire resources they don't have. Those with access to scarce resources can drive hard bargains. \n\nIn today's world, keeping students engaged is more important than ever. I try hard to be creative and accomplish this with skits, food tastings, videos and more. I believe adding this game and the accompanying assignments would be a valuable way to engage students while growing the critical thinking and writing skills. Students will be given writing assignments where they compare players in the game to real civilizations and explain how economics affects the game and the real world around them. "

Part of the program requires students to work on the computers for 20 to 25 minutes every day. Students must record themselves reading a passage that I then listen to and assess for fluency. The current headphones I have are five years old and often do not record the students' voices clearly, making it difficult for me to listen to their recordings and assess them accurately.  \n\nMy students are eager to record themselves. Many of them have never heard what they sound like when they read. Students will be able to hear themselves more clearly when they do self assessments which is critical if they want to read more fluently. Another added benefit would be that every student would be able to have their own set of headphones for the year, reducing the spread of germs and lice. "

Family incomes are based on a declining timber industry and over 30 percent of our population is on the free and reduced lunch program with numbers climbing daily. Many of my students do not have the opportunity to use digital cameras at home much less tell a story, support an idea, or just play. \n\nWith these digital cameras I will be able to give more than half of our 6th grade population (around 200 students) an opportunity to do those activities plus learn a little about digital photography, presentations, online safety issues surrounding the taking and posting of pictures, and collaborating with partners. They will start by choosing a book that has meaning to them then they will choose a setting and pose which promotes that book. We will do some basic editing and adding READ to our poster in the style of American Library Celebrity READ posters (which I will use as examples). The students will then print in color and post their works around the school and on the school library web page.\n\nThis project will not only promote our literacy plan and the media center but will get the students thinking and planning when they take pictures. \n\nYou generous gift of digital cameras will make it possible for these kids to think more about how stories are told with images and an opportunity to explore their creative side.

On the financial side of life, many students have difficulty paying for small supplies, not to mention having their own laptop or Ipad at home. There are many students at my school who live with multiple families in Motels--- these are students who do not have their own study space or bedroom. At this time, our school is about 96% Free and Reduced lunch. Not only do these kids have a disadvantage, they are a special group of kids who really want to go to college. They are students who are ""average"" by grades, but outstanding in drive, motivation, work ethic and heart. They are part of the AVID program, which is a nationally recognized program that stands for Advancement via Individual Determination. \n\nAs the year starts, I am already seeing my 7th and 8th graders set goals for themselves, identify academic individual challenges, and commit to serving their community through community service. The use of Ipads would help their goals become a reality. The last time my school site was able to purchase technology was in 2001. We were able to get a few laptops, and projectors.  Currently, we only have 4 old computers per class at a school of 1,500 students, and currently do not have a computer lab for teachers to use with their classes. With technology changing every year, these iPads and the accessories will provide the bridge between pencil and paper learning to virtual learning. Some ways we plan on using the Ipads are: accessing Math and Science tutoring websites, reading argumentative articles online, creating and recording lesson plans for Math and Science, and preparing for the SAT and ACT. My students need 2 iPads, keyboard cases for the iPads, headphones for the iPads and wireless speakers to be able to prepare students for college and career readiness.   \n\nOn a weekly basis, we will use the iPads in class with math and science peer tutoring. The iPads are necessary to help solve questions, and the headphones, as well as speakers, can help students hear the tutorial session on their devices either individually or in a group. Studies show that students who are able to teach each other are more likely to retain information, while Ipads grip the learner's attention. These days, these strategies can be powerful than just the teacher alone. "
Densely Populated Library Needs More Space,"Our carpet is too small for my 20 students.  Additionally, students do not have anywhere to sit and read independently.

Our carpet is too small for my 20 students.  Additionally, students do not have anywhere to sit and read independently. \n\nMy students are wonderful.  This year they've grown so much.  As I learn more about how to help struggling readers they are always open to changes.  Recently we've moved our classroom library and they've embraced this change with open arms.  They also love to read.  From the Black Lagoon series to Junie B. Jones they devour books. \n\nMy biggest challenge this year has been fitting my 20 third graders on a carpet in our library which would only be comfortably for half that amount of students.  When it is time to turn and talk with their partners about our lesson whether it be making predictions or main idea they always bump into each other.  With a bigger carpet we'd have more room and spend more time on our carpet.  Also, my students love to read.  They'd read anywhere.  Due to lack of seating they usually read at their desks.  They would love to have some big comfy seating in the library for independent reading time! \n\nI'd really love to be able to give my students something great to show how appreciative I am of their hard work and their ability to embrace the changes we've been through this year.  They'd be able to read more and learn more with a bigger library space. "

Magnetic boards with alphabet letters to build words targeting short and long vowel sounds, blends and diagraphs, spelling, and decoding words; phonics magnets to continue to build and develop vocabulary, a magnetic board to work on in literacy centers, picture-word correspondence, and word family activity cards with a corresponding cd to follow along and work in the listening station. \n\nI strongly believe that poverty should not be a barrier to learning. Young children should be given an opportunity to learn and grow, and not be limited in their academic success due to lack of classroom materials. When these children enter my classroom they have limited backgrounds in literacy.  When they leave I want them to know how to read and to develop a love of learning.  Your donation will help me to help them achieve this. "

Many come from hard working families and face some personal challenges stemming from broken homes. Despite these hardships, my students are enthusiastic learners. They ask questions and have great imaginations. They love to write and tell creative stories as well as personal stories. Our school has limited technological resources. We get the basic materials such as paper and pencils, and cannot afford more than the one computer they use in class. My students do not have computers at home and therefore the only time they get to use the computer is during class. \n\nStudents will be motivated to write even more with the use of the two netbook computers. With this addition, more of my students can use the computer each day. My students will be asked to write an original story with fictional characters. The use of word processing software will allow them to work smoothly through the stages of the writing process from brainstorming to publishing. Along the way, students will gain practice and experience performing basic functions of word processing as well as how to insert images to illustrate sections of their stories. The skills learned along the way will remain with my students beyond the third grade. The use of these netbook computers will set the foundation for the coming years and beyond. \n\nYour donations to this project will help my students become 21st century writers ready to face the challenges of the writing process. Students will be thrilled to have the opportunity to see their own and their classmates work published. Students will be proud of their writing and feel confident about learning basic computer skills. These netbooks will open a window of opportunities that my students once thought was out of their reach. "

As our school population is growing, funding can become more difficult when the budget does not grow proportionately. \n\nI have found a wonderful resource that I know my students in music will love. It's called ""Quaver's Marvelous World of Music."" It is a DVD, online, and interactive whiteboard system that is divided up into many units that directly correlate to subjects being taught in the music room. \n\nAlong with a DVD covering each topic, students will also have access to online resources, helping them experience quality musical resources for the computer at home. There is also a component which I can use in my classroom with the students in an interactive whiteboard which will keep them engaged in the lesson. \n\nAlthough this program is not a necessity for my students, I feel that providing them with support materials and ideas presented in ways that I can not teach them, the students will have an even greater musical experience at school as well as at home.

They are vibrant and energetic students who want to learn, but do not always have the resources at home to help support the concepts that have been taught in class.  While numbers are manipulated in the same way all over the world, many of my students have not be given the opportunity to explore the numbers to see how they truly work.  Once students understand the principle ideas for how numbers work, the other concepts in math, such as multiplication and division, fractions and geometry, will make sense to them.  They will no longer see math as a hard subject to learn, yet a fun subject in which they can relate to in the real world. \n\nMy students need engaging math games, puzzles, manipulatives and centers that present real-world math situations.  I have found that despite language difficulties for my students who have English as their second language, they are no different from English speaking students when it comes to learning and truly understanding math.  If students can understand how math is applied to everything they do each and every day, they will grasp the math concepts which they need to learn much quicker.  Understanding math concepts is much easier for my students when they are having fun and enjoying their learning experience. \n\nAll of my students need engaging and fun methods to learn and understand math and how it is applied to their everyday living.  These math games, puzzles, manipulatives and special centers will allow students to learn math concepts in a fun and engaging way by seeing how they are actually discovering and using that concept themselves.  These manipulatives will also help my students understand the importance of math and how it is used in our lives each and every day. "

","When we engage in dialogue and intellectual exchange, we change the world around us, for ourselves and others. Help us change the world, one conversation at a time. \n\nOur students have a great reputation as hard workers and strong students. They hunger for deeper understanding, and for chances to act on their learning. They want to engage the rest of the world and change lives. \nUnfortunately, as in many schools, the measure of success is test scores. Our students are receiving a message, loudly and clearly, that there is little time for them to process their learning, that they must ""sit and get"" information that will be on a test.\nFortunately, my students are optimistic. They believe that they can become leaders AND perform well on any assessment. They believe that if they are allowed to, they can participate in rigorous academic discussions that will deepen their learning, help them perform, and make them leaders.\nAn important note: they want to create discussion structures that work, not just participate in pre-existing ones. They want to be leaders in their communities, and practice for the freedom that awaits them. \n\nThe students will be creating discussion formats based in deep philosophical ideas. They wish to read these two books to gain a firm foundation in advocacy and social justice dialogue.\nThey will be taking time out of their own busy schedules, mainly during lunch and after school, to meet in weekly book talks, so that they may design discussion protocols and models that will first be used in history classrooms, then adapted to other content areas.\nThe philosophical ideas of Freire and hooks will guide their process. They will engage in civic dialogue, learn from each other, and I will act as facilitator and lead-learner. We see ourselves presenting to our school's faculty, and later, to the national network of which we are a part.  \n\nWhen students are called upon to embrace participatory democracy, they do so by way of the spoken word. This transforms them from passive learners to active ones. Speaking is a gateway skill to other important literacy skills. Their lives will change, because they will become advocates and facilitators in other areas of their lives. This will allow them to change the lives around them, like emanating rings. "

After understanding some basic principles, my students strive to explain natural phenomena and debunk supposed myths in physical and biological science. \n\nMy students are deeply talented in the arts, majoring in art, drama, vocal, or instrumental. Despite having gifts in the arts, they all have a deep desire to learn about the physical world around them. My students have asked my questions as to how a subway train runs, a smartboard functions to display a computer's display, and the Statue of Liberty's color transformation. \nThese students have an innate sense of curiosity for the natural world, but the resources at our school hinder them from fully experiencing science. My students come from a very impoverished background and are looking to strive beyond all of the socioeconomic barriers that they face.  \n\nA very difficult concept that my student grapple with is reaction rate kinetics and factors that affect it. It is very abstract and conceptual. However, the lab kit on reaction rate factors will allow students to very easily see the relationships between different variables on reaction rate. \nMoreover, most of my top students commute from long distances and have little if any access to a computer or a printer. Given their extreme home situations, it is difficult for a good number of them to venture to a library to print out lab reports, in-class assignments, or practice tests. Having an in-class printer would allow me to easily print out beneficial papers for students. Our school has limited supplies and students seldom find an available printer since staff have priority use.  \n\nHidden in all of the abstractness of chemistry are secrets to the workings of the physical world. Understanding concepts such as reaction rates through experimentation will allow students to comprehend how machines optimize certain chemical reactions function efficiently. \nFinally, the presence of an in-class printer will allow students with modest means to compete and have the same opportunities as their peers, allowing them to ore fully attain their potential.

The department has received less than $100 dollars this year. \n\nThe setting of our school is a culturally diverse with students from over 20 countries. They speak over 15 different languages. We serve over 250 kids. The majority of our population has lived in the US less than 2 years. Many of them have been here for only a few months. And most of our kids have not been in a formal education setting before, let alone a PE class. So they are fortunate and will get to experience a quality physical education program at our school. \n\nMost kids love PE and our school is no different. We like to think outside the box and play games that are creative and fun. Kin-Ball is a newly developed game that uses a large light-weight ball. It incorporates teamwork, strategy and hustle. The whole class can play. \nYes, believe it or not, they make the Omnikin Ultra Ball that is 23 inches in diameter. It's feather light and can be used in many cooperative learning games. It has a rubber bladder and is covered with a nylon lining. It can be used in the gym or outdoors. The ball can also be used with the scooters too. So it will be very interchangeable with many activities. \n \n\nWe know you care about kids and public education. So, please help us, help our non American born students develop the passion for PE and lifetime fitness activities. Your donation will be greatly appreciated. "

I have an interactive whiteboard in the front of the class, and the kids are amazed at how well they are able to manipulate words and sentences while doing exercises on the board.  While I love my board, I can't always be right in front of it. \n\nMy kids are not terribly interested in French in and of itself, so I have to find ways to make it interesting.  They are bright, but not always motivated.  They don't really have any concept of how different other cultures are until they begin studying a foreign language.  I love being able to introduce them to the French-speaking world and the French language.  Most of them come from lower-income families in Mississippi, and many have never been more than 20 miles from their homes.   \n\nWith these tools, I will be able to enhance the work we do at the Promethean board.  I will be able to work more closely with struggling students, as I will not be physically tied to the board in order to direct the work.  A lot of our daily practice is done on the board using a screen-shot of our book, and then using the Promethean pen to manipulate the questions into the answers.  The kids love doing this on the board, but often, when we are doing guided work, it's necessary that I be at the board explaining what I'm writing.  With the tablet, and the hub that allows it to be used anywhere in the room, I will be able to sit by the kids who need extra attention.  Anything I write on the ActivSlate will appear on the board, no matter where in my room I may be.\n\nThe USB FlashDrive will help to combat the extremely limited space available on my school computer's hard drive.  I use the same flipcharts two days in a row, so I need space to save them. \n\nTechnology in education is the wave of the future.  The kids that I teach are never more engaged than when they have an interactive copy of what we are learning.  These accessories for the Promethean board in my room, and the extra space to store what we do in class, will greatly improve the success rate of my students on their daily work.  ""Practice makes perfect"" and with these tools, my kids will LOVE to practice. "

On a daily basis I am trying to prepare my students for first grade and the world. \n\nMy students are facing challenges that many adults never face in their lifetime. Homelessness, lack of adequate food, clothing and often single parent households is the norm. Many of them are growing up without common resources that most people take for granted. Teaching in a school where more than 90% of the students are on free and reduced price lunch is challenging. Most of my students come from low socioeconomic households where they face very difficult situations on a daily basis. In addition, the majority of my class is ESL students who are working hard to learn English as a second language. \n\nI am requesting these thematic learning centers because they will continue to support the themes taught in class. Young children learn best through themes and these center activities will allow more engaging and differentiated centers for my students. Students will be able to facilitate their own learning and work together to create and explore. With your help we can give my students what they need to better their understanding of the content and build their background knowledge as well as continue to support their vocabulary development. \n\nThe reason these centers are so important is because students need time without the teacher to explore and reinforce what we have learned through teacher read stories, technology and class discussion. These center will allow students the support to be successful and learn independently. "

Using technology such as iPads in the classroom supports interventions, student motivation and success increases while using educational apps. \n\nI teach at a Tittle 1 school. Most of my students come from low income homes and are on free or reduced lunch, but they do not let anything get in the way of their learning. They are the best behaved, most eager to learn group of students I have ever met! I am so lucky I get to spend my days with them. I love and support my students. I will not stop until they have the tools they need to be successful in and out of our classroom. Please help me make this a reality! \n\nOne thing that our classroom community really needs is 2 iPad minis and 2 cases. Not only will students be more engaged but they will also be more motivated to participate during class. With the use of an iPad in the classroom, my students will be able to access more than 200,000 apps to help with their math and reading. iPads minis are the perfect size and weight for my first graders to practice and reinforce critical math and reading skills! \n\nThe iPad minis will create an engaging way to infuse technology as a learning tool while still ultimately improving student achievement. Your contribution will make a lasting impact on my little learners. Please donate to this project as it will allow my Mavericks a different way to THINK, LEARN and READ. Thank you in advance for supporting our classroom community! "

","Dirty hands, engaged lessons, and teaching students to make a  positive impact on the world is what "" Our Amazing World"" is all about. Students will participate in several hands-on lessons while learning about the world of animals and plants within various ecosystems. \n\n"" Our Amazing World "" will give students the opportunity to study various ecosystems of our world.  They will be given the opportunity to learn about plants and animals in these ecosystems.   They will also experiment with how environmental changes can affect an ecosystem.  Students will research and create displays related to ecosystems found all over the world. Through this project, students will be able to bring the ""outside world"" into the classroom. \n\nOur school is a small public school in a rural county in South Carolina. The resources available to our school are very limited. Many of our students love art , but with our limited budget , few supplies are available for our students. Our students are primarily from families, of all types, who care a great deal about their education while providing for their educational needs as they are able. The students in our school thrive on engaging lessons taught through hands-on experiences. \n\n""Our Amazing World""  will enable students to have a first-hand experience with the study of five ecosystems. Our project begins with a guest speaker visiting the classroom and sharing her knowledge of plants. The focus will be on plants  found in various ecosystems.  Students will then go outside to our school garden and transplant  plants. They will then be given the opportunity to take home a plant. Another component of the project involves students planting radish seeds . They will then experiment ,while taking qualitative and quantitative observations ,  to demonstrate how plant growth can be changed by altering its environment. A final component of this project is to research plants and animals of various ecosystems. Focus will also be on how humans can help to protect each type of ecosystem for years to come. This project offers many opportunities for students to use their math and reading skills while enhancing their knowledge of science . \n\nStudents do not have to have a ""green thumb"" in order to be successful with this endeavor. Students will have many opportunities to learn about plants and animals through the hands- on activities that this project provides. Students will not only learn about ecosystems of the world, but also how to protect ecosystems for future generations. By starting while students' are young, one of these students may very well make changes in the future that will make our world a better place to live! "

Our school is a title I school since over 90% of the students qualify for free or reduced breakfast and lunch.  My students are unable to afford the basics and also books.  My students are enthusiastic about reading and crave good books.  My students also like to be organized and have a nice place to store their books.  In addition to these requested supplies, we concentrate better when our body is in motion.  We would like to have fitness balls to sit on so we can pay attention better and learn more.  At the end of the school year, we would love to share our favorite books with the entire school.  We will do this by creating a book cover of our favorite book, then drawing it on the sidewalk so all can see.  We need sidewalk chalk in order to do this.  We love relating literacy with art.   \n\nEvery day for thirty minutes, we have what is called, Read and Relax.  Read and Relax is where students choose a comfortable location in the room and read silently.  It's a time for students to read for the pure enjoyment of reading.  It's also a great opportunity for students to increase their reading levels in order to better prepare themselves to transition to the middle school next year.  We are requesting more books to add to our small classroom library.  We are also requesting book bins for each student to store their favorite books in. The students will read these books during Read and Relax and then store their books in the book bins for easy access.  This will give the students great pride in taking care of their books.  A 3-shelf storage center will also help us store books for our classroom library.  As mentioned above, we would love to sit on fitness balls in order to better focus on our reading.  When our bodies are in motion, we are most alert. \n\nNot only will your donation be impacting the students this year, but for countless students to come.  You are helping students to be more organized and take pride in the book bins.  The students will get excited about reading and will have easy access to their selected books.  These resources are something that the students do not have at home and would make them feel like a part of the classroom community.  It will teach the students how to be good citizens in the classroom.  "

Buck, the beloved dog of Call of the Wild will keep readers interested in following the journey. \n\nMy 7th grade students are becoming more engaged readers, who beg for more reading time every day. The students, avid animal lovers, had an important role in helping choose this novel.  We are located in a tight-knight community in NE Indiana, with a rural middle school that has 600 students.  \n\nThe students learned about the plot of Call of the Wild and were already interested in reading the book--a great moment in the heart of their reading teacher. What truly became inspiring is what they want to do AFTER they read the story. They are inspired to teach others about the importance of responsible pet ownership. We have a local animal shelter that is always at or near capacity, and the students want to use this novel to inspire them to create public service announcements for our local animal shelter.  \n\nThis opportunity would give the students a chance to each have a book to read on their own, an opportunity often not possible with our rural area. The students created this curriculum request on their own, with the inspiration of helping other animals at our local humane shelter. Even the most reluctant readers have started counting the days until we can begin following Buck on his journey to freedom, while encouraging others to open their hearts to pets in need of forever homes.

Giving teachers remotes for their PowerPoint presentations allows them to give group instruction and individualized instruction all at the SAME time! \n\nI teach in a title 1 school, which means most of my students qualify for free or reduced lunches.  The only way to qualify for these types of programs is to have a total household income below certain defined levels.  My students LOVE it when I use the Smartboard in the classroom and enjoy the videos, animations, and sound effects I can integrate into the lessons.  These students attend an inner-city school which has been deemed persistently low achieving.  Let's help these students achieve! \n\nPutting remotes into the teachers hands will allow students to gain more one-on-one time with the teachers.  This is desperately needed as there is only 43 minutes each period to reach classes that include over 30 students.  The push for differentiated instruction is a prime example of why we need to be able to make our classrooms more efficient with technology. \n\nAny time you can spend clarifying student understanding in the classroom in priceless.  If the class can learn from slides in a presentation while the teacher can explain misconceptions to struggling learners, you have truly created an efficient and effective classroom.  In addition, teaching students how to give a good presentation is a life skill they could truly benefit from. "

I am a NY high school biology and marine science teacher. My classes are generally composed of freshman and sophomore students, many of whom, when they first come to me, seem to have lost that childhood curiosity for the world around them that was, at one time, so insatiable!!  \n\nScience is a hands-on discipline, students learn best when they complete and write about activities or experiments that they conduct themselves! As we all know, the recent budget crisis has hit schools especially hard and so funding for supplies for over 30 biology is beyond the financial capabilities of our school. During lab classes, when students should ideally being doing activities, they usually complete paper labs that simulate the real deal. So it is up to the individual teacher to find fun ways to stimulate our students' minds and get them excited about the topics we are learning. \n\nThis is especially true for ecology related topics. My very urban students barely see trees as there is very little green space here in NYC and few students live near these areas.  We need to bring the environment to our classroom because there is precious little of it outside!   \n\nAnd so, I have decided to try and create an in class greenhouse - which can run throughout the year and be related to multiple units – from cell division and reproduction to plant biology to evolution, and of course ecology.  And in addition it will help to create a more welcoming classroom experience as well as begin to induce in the students an deeper appreciation of nature. \n\nScience can be a difficult subject, full of an almost entirely new language of scary words and concepts that seem so far removed from a teenager's daily life. I know that if I can get them excited about coming to class; if I can make them curious about what is coming next, then the battle is already half won! Even more important, these types of group based, hands on activities prepare students for the types of experiences that they will have in college and beyond!\n\nI just need your help!! \n "

These kids deserve a break every once and awhile, and I'm determined to see to it that they have some fun while exploring their creative potential.\n\nThe Talented Arts program is one of the bright spots in my students' lives. My program is designed to provide these exceptional children with an opportunity to develop their natural creative skills and talents while exploring the connections between art and other core subjects.\n\nThe time my students spend with me working on hands-on art projects is one of the rare chances they are given to truly succeed, be appreciated and respected, and be part of a team. The success that they experience working on exciting ""outside the box"" creative projects in my classroom has the potential to ripple through the rest of their lives. \n\nFor the 2011-2012 school year, I want to give my kids the chance to explore printmaking in a range of formats including silkscreen, etching, and lino-block prints. I am requesting a variety of printmaking supplies and materials. These printmaking project will expose my class to the methods and techniques used to make t-shirts, fine art prints, mixed-media collages and more.  It will be exciting and inspirational and give them a whole new set of skills and techniques to use in their creative endeavors. Children in our school system very rarely get to use anything more than pencil and paper to create artwork. I'm trying to change that in some bold and radical ways. \n\nOver the last few years, I have worked with the same core group of students, and they have learned a wide range of art-making techniques. Now I want to give them the opportunity to create their own prints and explore another media. My students are super-excited about everything we are planning to do, and our previous projects have shown them how much they are capable of and given them a taste of success and huge boosts in confidence. Your generosity is helping to change their lives in real ways! "

This year I will be co-teaching a second grade ESOL support classroom. Most of my students are of either Puerto Rican or Dominican descent. \n\nMy school serves about 1000 students K-4. Unfortunately, as a large school with limited resources and high needs, there is little money for ""extra"" supplies, such as student binders. But we need them! My kids are passionate about poetry. Right now we have one class poetry binder and they are always edging each other to read it. My hope is that they may each have their own personal poetry binders.\n\nI am also asking for a stool to save my legs and swollen ankles. (I'm too young for my ankles to swell, but they do! - after standing all day.) I work largely from a computer projector in the middle of my classroom. Often, I end up sitting on kids' desks while teaching. A stool is not in our budget unfortunately. \n\nThis year, there is a real focus on poetry in our classroom. Every day we read the poem of the week, usually by our favorite author, Ken Nesbitt. At the end of the week, the students get their own copy of the poem to keep and illustrate. Unfortunately, without binders, they have no safe, organized way to keep their poems. \n\nIf each child were to have his or her own binder, however, they could keep their poems in good condition in a place easily accessible for after-work reading.

I had to wait until high school biology. I want more for my students.  If I am going to close the achievement gap in my schools and district, I must work to close the experience gap.  Every child deserves to be inspired. \n\nEach day I arrive at a different school with a hand truck loaded with science materials.  I am a science specialist, and I strive to make science real for approximately 650 fourth and fifth grade students at five schools each week.  (Picture: view from inside a hot air balloon that I built to teach convection) For the past six years, I have been working to close the achievement gap in elementary science.  Although I have yet to accomplished my goal, I have worked to boost achievement, and in the process I have earned some very prestigious honors: 2007  California Teacher of the Year and 2008 Presidential Award for Excellence in Math and Science Teaching.  My students are joyful, curious, and quite frankly, the reason for my accolades.  They inspire me to do all I can to make learning rigorous, hands-on, and fun.   I am seeking four microscopes to create an activity station for a traveling science discovery museum that I have been developing and presenting for the past fifteen years. \n\nMy students need to experience science with their families.  I am requesting four microscopes to add a life science exhibit to an existing science night program. Each science night  fills a multipurpose room with nearly fifty hands-on activities and a variety of activity stations with one goal in mind: bringing families to the school to experience the joy of discovery.  Children glide across the floor on a home-made hovercraft,  make recycled paper, balance a ball on a column of air, and test their structures on an earthquake shake table.  Science Night teaches more than science; it shows how much we care about our students and their families. At one science night, a first grader was fascinated with the ""World's Simplest Motor"" exhibit.  That weekend, he drew a picture of the motor for his grandfather. The two of them did some research and built their own version.  His family was puzzled.  They couldn't figure out how he could know how to build an electric motor.  After some probing questions, they realized that he learned how at Science Night.  Microscopes will add a life science component to a museum that is dominated by physical science. \n\nSupporting this project will add a key activity to an already successful Science Night program that reaches hundreds of families each year. The microscopes will also become a resource for teachers in my district.  Most importantly, a child may examine some granitic sand or an elodea leaf and shout, ""Look, Mommy."" And in that moment of discovery and attention, she realizes that she is a scientist. "

All of the materials in this kit will help my struggling students gain the skills and confidence they need to become active, engage learners while they gain essential pre-reading, early literacy skills.\n\nGive my struggling Kindergarten students the tools they need to succeed.  You would make it possible for my students to develop key pre-reading, early literacy skills in the areas of phonological awareness, print awareness, alphabet knowledge, and oral language.  This kit would also be used as intervention for targeted kindergarten students in our Kindergarten Annex."

Reading can be a fun and imaginative activity for children, which opens doors to all kinds of new worlds for them. I want to create an environment that makes literacy fun and exciting. \n\nI am the second mother, I like to think, to 20 beautiful 4 year old students, 12 boys and 8 girls. I teach at a school that is Pre-k through 8th grade. When many of my students entered my classroom in August, they came straight from home.  School was something new, exciting, but kind of scary. But with a lot of love and support we are on our way to becoming successful students as well as readers.    \n\nI am asking that my project be funded to help me, help my students develop the listening, speaking, writing, thinking, and reading skills needed for successful readers. The supplies selected will allow one on one instruction as well as individualized instruction. My students are at the age were learning the basic foundation for reading is NOW!  My students are developing the knowledge to understand how oral language is transferred into written words.  \n\nWith your help, I will be able to continue building a solid foundation in language development for my students. Research has shown, children who have a rich and positive language and literacy experience are less likely to have difficulties learning to read. The materials selected will enhance our daily activities.  They will provide opportunities for interaction with typically developing peers.   "

","Google, Microsoft, Apple...oh my! Help bring technology into our classroom. Technology is the future and by giving my kids access to a projector, document camera and interactive camera you are helping them have a brighter future as well.  \n\nI currently have the pleasure of teaching 30 beautiful, smart second graders. My students attend a bilingual dual immersion school in California and our school district serves lower socioeconomic families. My students are fluent in both Spanish and English and we spend half our day speaking Spanish and half in English. Our theme for the year is Global Citizenship and exploring our world. My students love learning about geography, different cultures, customs and traditions. They are hungry for knowledge and desire to grow and be good people more than anything. We love to do art and we use a lot of music during our time together. We are a family and every morning when we enter we recite a part of our creed. ""Estoy chiquito pero puedo hacer cosas grandes"" which means ""I am little but I can do big things"". My students face many challenges yet they are always eager to learn and I have no doubt my students will be the future leaders of not only our community, but our world.                   \n\nIn our classroom, there are Spanish Language learners and English learners. Technology is a great way to give my kids access to content and give them the best education possible. I plan on using the projector, document camera and interactive whiteboard to help my students connect with material. I plan on using all of these products daily to show videos of what we are learning, put interactive charts and pictures on my boards so we can label vocabulary and use the projector to have my students give presentations to build their public speaking and self confidence. For some of my kids, the world seems really small, consisting of their home and school. With access to technology, media, visuals my students can interact with things that are outside their world. We will be looking at Google earth, photos, landmarks, videos of different cultures and even looking up words we don't know. For example, last week my students didn't know the word 'garage' because in our community many don't have one. \n\nThis project is so important to me and is so important for my students because in order to be a global citizen my students need exposure to technology and need to use and interact with technology. Due to socioeconomic circumstances my students do not have access to technology. My students are brilliant and deserve equal opportunities as their peers in more affluent schools. By giving to this project you'll be making content accessible to my students and also giving them to opportunity to succeed.  "

We used to play outside all the time, dig in dirt, ride bikes, and enjoy nature in different aspects.  \n\nMy students are amazing.  Most of my students live below the poverty level for Texas.  The only meals they may eat that day are at school.  They wear hand-me-down clothes.  Not one of those previous statements keeps my students from being happy.  My students love to come to school because they are excited to explore new things that they otherwise would not have had the privilege to do so.  The school they attend is in a rough neighborhood and the school is broke.  We are very fortunate if the student even brings pencils to school.  Most of the supplies in the classroom are ones the teacher has purchased.  These students are some of the hardest working kids I have ever met.  They work for the things they are given and take special care of the things because stuff means more to them.  They never know if they will get to experience that moment again so they cherish it.  They truly are an amazing group.  \n\nThe resources I have requested will allow my students the opportunity to use a real microscope.  Many of them will not use a microscope until high school, and in my opinion, that can be too late.  I can show my students how to properly use a microscope and hope someday one of them becomes a scientist.  I have requested plant/seed kids also so they can grow plants and study their parts using the microscope.  They will be required to keep a very detailed journal with drawings and notes.  The students will not only learn about plants, microscopes, and science, they will learn a life skill that could one day become their career if they work for it.  \n\nThese students have never and may never have the opportunity to work with a microscope, especially with all the budget cuts teachers and schools are facing.  This donation would mean that my students would have the opportunity to experience something that others will not.  Planting seeds will teach the students responsibility on caring for something over a period of time.  If this request is granted it will give my students the hope that someone still cares about the value of a good education. "
"Bump, Set, Spike: Help Serve Us Over The Net!","My students need 6 volleyballs to facilitate both physical education and team volleyball practice at my school. With the addition of these volleyballs we can implement skill development drills such as bumping, setting, spiking and serving the ball in 6 separate lines.",My students need 6 Volleyballs to facilitate volleyball practice this fall. ,"The primary challenge facing my students is a lack of economic support from the educational system.  Private schools in the area have education budgets that spend twice as much per child compared to poor public schools. This discrepancy limits the amount of recourse's my students have access to. \n\nMy students are from one of the most culturally dynamic cities in the country and have been inspirational to work with. Demographic information is as follows; 97.3% African American, 1.8% Latino/a American, 0.3% Asian American/Pacific Islander, 0.3% Native American and 0.3% European American. 99% of my students qualify for free or reduced lunch programs; however, poverty does not define my students. Our test scores rank the highest of public schools in the area, and compare well to private school test scores which have selective enrollment and twice as large spending budgets per child. My students are resilient and overcome obstacles such as Hurricane Katrina. In addition, my students participate in a variety of school activities such as; marching band, dance and drill team, majorettes, book club, service learning, yearbook, volleyball, flag football, basketball, softball and track. \n\nMy students need 6 volleyballs to facilitate both physical education and team volleyball practice at my school. With the addition of these volleyballs we can implement skill development drills such as bumping, setting, spiking and serving the ball in 6 separate lines. Currently we have an entire class or team share 1 volleyball. This makes the volleyball unit in gym class tedious and volleyball practice limited. My students need repetitions at these skill development drills in order to improve hand-eye coordination and to become proficient in these volleyball skills. \nWith your help my students can learn the game of volleyball and develop team skills and self confidence through sport. As an educator my job is to expose young minds to as many experiences as possible. If I expose my students to volleyball now, perhaps ten might play in high school, and perhaps some will play in college and beyond. I want my students to have the opportunity to explore a variety of activities. \n\nI will leave you with some wisdom from world renowned educator Paulo Freire, ""Leaders must realize that their own conviction of the necessity for struggle was not given to them by anyone else-if it is authentic. This conviction cannot be packaged and sold; it is reached, rather, by means of a totality of reflection and action. Only the leaders' own involvement in reality, within an historical situation, led them to criticize this situation and to wish to change it."" "

There is no one alive who is Youer than You."" - Dr. Seuss.\nHelp my students see how Roald Dahl saw himself through his autobiography in order for my students to identify who they themselves are in writing an autobiography. \n\nMy students live in a very rough neighborhood where they are constantly surrounded by negativity.  They come from broken homes, low income, gang and drug infested neighborhoods.  The one place they have that is a safe haven is school.  Our school offers them a place they can come and make a better life for themselves and escape the negatives that life has dealt them.  Our school prides itself on community and making sure all voices are heard.  While at school students are given two meals, a snack, a strong education, and values that they can take and apply to their own lives.  In my classroom, I try and show students that we can make this a better world to live in but it starts with recognizing what has gone wrong and what we can do to fix it.  Students leave my classroom knowing what they can do to make a better life for themselves.  They also know that our school will always be home for them. \n\nPlease help my students to recognize what values lie in their childhood.  By obtaining Roald Dahl's autobiography, Boy, students will see that everyone has their own story to tell and the details that go into those stories.  From there, my students will be able to write their own stories from their childhood.  I hope that this will help them to realize the value in their lives and how, no matter their past, rise to their own goals in life.   Once again, Please help support my students in realizing who they are, set life goals, and of course build skills to writing their own autobiography. \n\nYour donation will allow my students to see the values and structure of a famous writer's autobiography and then apply that knowledge to their own lives.  My students will be able to read, write, and be inspired from your generous contribution! "

They attend an average size middle school in an urban area. Most of them receive free or reduced lunches due to income levels. \n\nScrabble not only challenges their spelling abilities, but it will encourage them to think strategically and foster healthy competition. Many of them don't feel successful at school, but they love board games. Strategic thinking transfers over to so many areas in life, and I know they will love playing it. \n\nI truly believe that integrating Scrabble into my English curriculum will help my students raise their reading levels and encourage a love of reading and learning.

A limited budget makes it difficult to obtain enough materials for high quality instruction in every classroom. \n\nSince my students struggle with learning content and learning English at the same time, I have to provide many opportunities for engaging hands-on curriculum.  Doing lab activities and using manipulatives are strategies recommended for improving students use of academic vocabulary and increasing retention of information. Both of these are vital in a beginning biology course.  These investigations provide an opportunity for students to learn in a lab setting which will help prepare them for the rigors of a college level science class. \n\nMany of my students proceed to advanced Biology, even though they struggle with language, and its only through the use of such activities and manipulatives that they are able to remember many of the key lessons and vocabulary in order to pass the class.  I am requesting dialysis tubing for a membrane lab, food web game and fossil kit for ecology, worm compost bin for a lesson on environmental responsibility, and skulls for a human skull comparison activity in evolution. \n\nOur next unit on Ecology/Evolution has the potential to be more engaging and hands-on than ever.

These children face all sorts of financial and emotional obstacles at home. Many students change schools 4-5 times in one school year and end up well behind their peers in reading, writing and math. Through no fault of their own, they see hardships that I would not wish upon anyone. I strive to remove those obstacles at school. We are at an urban public school that acknowledges the importance of technology and keeping our students up to date. Funding cuts and a shortage of resources have drastically reduced our ability to meet their needs.  I've seen my students overcome huge educational obstacles by being  exposed to technology on a daily basis. \n\nWith an IPad 2, my students will be able to learn, do research, read books, play educational games and discover things about science and the arts on the Internet. We can use SKYPE to communicate with students in other classrooms, schools and countries. We can take field trips without physically leaving the classroom. It will allow us to bring the community into our classroom. Students can interview and film each other doing projects. It is such motivation for the students to watch themselves in plays, singing songs, and teaching each other on video done with the iPad. \n\nMy students need help from DonorsChoose and Fans of Adam Lambert to make their dreams of technology in the classroom a reality.

This year I will have 12 students, 3 girls and 9 boys.  My students and their families are the best!  The students always put forth their best efforts, and their families are dedicated and involved in the child's education. \n\nThese resources will enable me to help differentiate my student's academic instruction. I want to provide them with an education that teaches them academic content, but also give them the confidence to know that they will be successful throughout their educational careers. Students with special needs need encouragement, compassion, and strategies to help them succeed. Some of the items that I am requesting that would truly make a difference in my classroom are a world globe, reading comprehension games, write and wipe off boards, and math fact games. With these items, I would be able to be a more effective teacher for my students. \n\nThis project is so important, because if it is fulfilled, I know that I can provide a better quality education for my students. I want to make their learning fun, interactive, and meaningful.  My students and their families know how important their education is to me, and I want to ensure I do everything I can to help them. "

Imagine an outdoor classroom, designed, researched, and built by students for students; a place of peace and love. Bright smiles, social connection, and hands-on exploration invite academic bridges to common core standards. \n\nNestled in a small river valley, approximately three hundred fifty fifth through eighth grade students are served by this middle school. Many students come from multi-generational poverty, and parents lack necessary skills to teach children health and nutrition. California is facing a state wide obesity rate of thirty percent, while this county sits closer to sixty percent! I believe that having students involved in garden space will not only help connect them to nature, but also encourage better health and fitness through applied science, math, language arts, and social studies. \n\nStudents learn the best by doing. In this project, students will research, design, and build a garden on our campus. The tools requested will help students to see the actual product of the learning and planning we will begin with. Preparing soil can only be accomplished with tools and elbow grease. Students will be greatly rewarded by their perseverance and empathy beginning with the foundation for a sustainable garden. Students armed with shovels, rakes, and buckets will learn far more  outside, than by sitting in a classroom everyday. \n\nIt is time to consider fall crops. The winds are gently changing. Vegetables like lettuce, kale, spinach, and cauliflower will flourish towards late November if the ground is amended soon, and seeds are planted. Literally placing tools in the hands of children will encourage team work, better health, and a practical application of math and science skills. Through activities like community work days, food tastings, and garden camps, families and student lives will be changed."

They are very attracted to games, technology, and computers.  I want to use the Leap Pads as a tool to reinforce what I am teaching, yet allow them to enjoy the learning experience in a way they are familiar with and be fully engaged.   Our school has a very diverse economic demographic and we receive little district/state funding.  Our families are amazing and supportive, yet many do not have the financial means to provide these learning tools for their children at home.    \n\nMy active, fun, energetic, bright students will be thrilled with the new addition of these tools to our classroom!  I will be able to work with other students while they are working independently and receiving immediate feedback from the Leap Pads.  I will also use these tools to reteach, maintain, and enrich the learning of all my students.   \n\nI have been teaching for 37 years and am amazed at how technology has changed my teaching!

Like worms around an apple, the students surround a big book placed on the floor and examine the photos, discuss details in the pictures, locate new vocabulary, practice sounding out words, and re-tell the story. In our big book collection, we have works of fiction and non-fiction, and the students particularly love the large format for pictures of dinosaurs and ocean life.\n\nRight now our collection is stacked against a wall until the books slowly slide down to the rug and end up in a vertical pile. It's messy, frustrating, and inhibits students' ability to independently retrieve the one they want. Might you please consider helping us better store our big books so our little bookworms can easily select, share, and devour them?\n\nThank you for reading this proposal, and if funded, the bookworms will send you words of gratitude."

This will allow ESL students to accelerate their learning, as they will not have to wait to quietly ask the meaning of a word, but instead they will have instant access.  The rich vocabularies that they bring in their native tongues will literally translate into much greater ease with English.  The students will be able to instantly find not only the meaning, but the pronunciation of words they already know in Spanish but are as yet unable to use in English. \n\nIf you have even struggled trying to recall words in a new language and remember the extra effort that it took, then you can easily picture the support a speaking dictionary will provide to our ESL students."

I will also be able to modify my teaching on the spot to better assist my students as questions arise. ",My students need a portable overhead projector.,"I am a second grade teacher in Illinois.  The students in my 2nd grade classroom come from a Hispanic background.  Most, if not all, are second language learners.  The poverty levels soars above 85% of the school.  This is a very high needs public school that has a tight budget for supplies.  \n\nI feel that to best teach in today's world, there is a great need for technology.   Currently, our school is going through purchases of much needed material.  However, the materials are based on necessity.  Mostly, the entire budget gets assigned to purchasing new textbooks for ones that are outdated by more than 10 years.  The most effective and eye catching way to keep kids engaged in all subject areas is through technology assistance.  A overhead projector will open the window to new presentations that are beneficial to learning. \n\nIn order to present new material in a powerful and economical way, I need a overhead projector.  With this I will be able to create displays that are eye catching.  My students as well as my future students, are bombarded with technology day in and day out.  To place a book in front of them as the sole mean of teaching is an unrealistic request.  Their attention spans have been dimished due to tv and video games.  They need graphics and some type of technology to go along with the book material in order to truly grasp what they are learning.  An overhead projector will allow me to create those graphics and interesting displays of material economically.  All I have to do is create a page size display and then project it large on the screen.  They will love it and it will keep their attention as they will think it is a movie on the screen!\n\nIt will make all the difference in truly understanding material.  I will be able to present information in a new and exciting way.  On top of this, I will also be able to modify my teaching on the spot to better assist my students as questions arise.  I simply have to display my teaching on the overhead and it will be projected largely and clearly for the students.  I will not waste time filling a large board with material but a small screen that is projected large than the board.  You will help ensure my students understand all material and are exposed to new technology which will help them in future years."

I feel like I can honestly say, 'I'm a reader.'""  This admission was delivered by a student that struggled all school year when confronting  reading of any kind.  A breakthrough, certainly; but, the frequency with which I'd hear such statements from my students indicates a much more critical situation.  At our high-needs school, several teachers have invested in a silent, sustained independent reading project to model and encourage students unaccustomed to reading for themselves.   \n\nThe success of this program has hidden costs among its obvious, measurable benefits.  I've spent hundreds of dollars, and invested countless hours building and maintaining a classroom library of high-interest books for my students.  Because they are read by so many, they often don't have a long shelf life.  My classroom library is in dire need of replenishing, to the point where I will have to suspend this program until I can supplement my income enough to buy more books. \n\nThe books I've selected have been consistent hits with my students.  I've submitted the titles to our school library, but the budget for new novels and texts would only allow for a few titles.  It is also necessary to have the books in the classroom, on hand.  When I dialogue with a student about his/her interests, it is crucial to be able to reach out my hand and produce the actual recommended texts to the student. \n\nThe majority of our students will not read for themselves on mere suggestion.  For too many, the demands of their lives outside of school are too great.  I view this program and their schooling here to be the last, best chance at developing the autodidactic skills necessary for their full development as a prominent, productive citizens in our democracy.

We carefully intersperse highly structured activities with movement and sensory opportunities to make sure they are at their best for learning.  We use visual supports, schedules, and task analyses to keep them on track. \n\nOur school is located in the inner city limits serving about 160 students with multiple disabilities. Our students, ages three to twenty-one years, suffer from severe and complicated physical and cognitive disabilities. Serving children beginning at a young age enables teachers, paraprofessionals and therapists to maximize the potential within each child. After completing their education at the Baer School, young adults may go on to an adult day care environment or to a special education high school in the area.  Some students go on to hold a job in a sheltered work environment. Our school has been around for over 70 years and is a staple in the special education community. School budgets are tighter than ever, so we depend greatly on the generosity of our community neighbors to help meet the needs of our special students. Our students have unique needs that cannot be met by traditional school and district funding. \n\nThe furniture and materials requested will be used during our scheduled work/learn times.  Each student has a personalized schedule to work on academic, fine motor, language, and communication skills.  Because they are pretty distractible, their individual work can be accomplished best when using work carrels.  Small groups (2-3 students) can work at the rectangular tables in another area of the room.  During these activities, social skills such as turn-taking, greeting, requesting, and commenting can be targeted.  All of my students benefit from multi-sensory materials.  They particularly enjoy materials with sound output.  Quite frequently, they imitate the sounds or words produced by the materials.  In this way, they are working on literacy skills at the same time they are targeting speech production.  They are very 'visual' students.  Use of visual schedules and picture symbols help facilitate communication and language development. \n\nEach one of  my children has amazing potential!  I see them learning new skills everyday!  They are starting to generalize what they learn in the classroom to other areas of the school and our local community.  By enhancing their classroom experience, you are enhancing their ability to become a contributing member of society.  Please help them reach their potential!  Thank you! "

This is what it can be like every day for my students with Autism. My students are part of a center-based Elementary Autism program in a public school. \n\nMy students struggle every day with a variety of challenges; however, one of the most prominent challenges for them is managing their sensory systems. These students are very smart and witty, but often become overwhelmed or underwhelmed by common things in our environments through sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell. \n\nThe resources I am requesting will allow my students to regulate their sensory systems so that they can better participate in the daily activities of the mainstream school environment. The students will learn how the different sensory tools available work to regulate various sensory systems so they can become more independent in managing their needs.  \n\nThe resource I am requesting is a ball pit with balls. Ball pits are a proven method for helping students regulate their sensory system. When a student surrounds their body with balls in the pit, it provides deep pressure similar to a hug. This calms the student's system and helps them to learn more effectively. \n\nThis project will impact the current students in our program, as well as future students so that they may have more calm and balanced lives. Just think what your life would be like if there was constant sensory chaos all around you. \n\nThink of that one time when you were overwhelmed by a bad smell that never seemed to go away, and you have a small idea of what it is like for my students on a daily basis.

Ender's Game Books,"In today's high-stakes testing environment, many students are learning the base skills but are not developing a love of reading.  This is not helped by the lack of reading materials available, especially enough for all students to be reading the same novel at the same time.","My students need 125 copies of ""Ender's Game"" so that each student may have a copy to take home and use for assignments outside of class.","A quote that always encapsulated my love of reading and literature is C.S. Lewis: ""We read to know we are not alone,"" yet the more statistics I read about the lack of adults who read at all leaves me feeling our nation is in danger of isolation through a lack of literature. I teach ninth grade English in a rural community where many of my students are struggling and reluctant readers. Many who come to my classroom hate reading and may have never read a book for enjoyment. \n\nIn today's high-stakes testing environment, many students are learning the base skills but are not developing a love of reading, creating what Kelly Gallagher coined as ""readicide.""  These students are not finding meaningful engagement in the classroom and do not see the connection between school and their lives at home, prompting many to drop out and never realize their potential for higher education.\n\nIn order to instill a love of reading in my students while teaching in my classroom, I would like to purchase enough copies of the book ""Ender's Game"" for my students. ""Ender's Game"" is a book capable of reaching reluctant readers, especially boys. In the past I have had students who never read a book before for pleasure read the entire ""Ender's Game"" series after being exposed to the book.  Additionally, ""Ender's Game"" is interdisciplinary. While teaching students close reading and literary analysis, I can also use this book to teach mathematics, history, science, and philosophy (ethics). It also has many real world connections through discussions on themes of warfare and genocide.  Through the study of this book my students will become better thinkers who are more aware of the world around them, more prepared for college, and become active members of society.\n\nBy engaging students in the material in the classroom and making the connections between the events and themes in the book and the world they live in, my students will be more willing to come to school each day and more interested in learning the material.  Many of my students are at risk of not graduating from high school, and I believe by teaching the standards they need through meaningful, high interest reading material, I will help them stay in school through high school and into college.\nI would like to purchase enough copies of the book for each of my students to have a copy to take home as ""Ender's Game"" is too long for us to be able to read the entire book in the classroom. \nYour generosity will help instill a love of reading in my students; one I hope to nurture to be lifelong.

This was the reaction of most of the students who entered my third grade classroom at the beginning of the school year.  In the high-need community where I teach, reading generally hasn't been made a priority in my students' lives.  Many of them hadn't had access to books until entering school, and even then, a majority of them can't get reading help at home from their parents who don't speak English.\n\nMany of my students have a very negative view of reading because they've had no freedom in electing to read what they want to read in a school setting.  Texts have been pre-selected, forced on them, and in many cases, followed with too many assessments.  This has framed reading in their minds as a tedious assignment, and for many, a frustrating one at that.\n\nAs students in a Title I school, my kids are over tested and have grown a disdain for reading in part due to its association in their mind with tricky, multiple-choice test questions.  Some students came to my class with the idea that we only read so we can get the right answer to those questions.  Having never read to satisfy a desire to know or understand what they're reading about has hindered the development of comprehension skills.\n\nAdding to these challenges is the statistic that nearly half of my students are English language learners and have to work a lot harder to understand what they're reading than native speakers do.  The frustration they experience only increases when they go home and their parents can't help them with their English text.\n\nI plan on tackling these problems from two angles.\n\nThe leveled fluency passages and accompanying CD will give students the freedom to pick a passage topic that genuinely interests them.  Reading along with a cassette will improve fluency and oral expression, which ultimately will help with their comprehension.    Having picked the passage they are practicing based on interest, students will be much more likely to pay attention and gain something from what they’ve just read. \n\nTo help build up those comprehension strategies, I would use the high interest comprehension passages, each of which focuses on a particular skill.  These passages are short, and the comprehension skill being taught is explicitly addressed at the end of this passage.\n\nTo give needed support to my English language learners, I will use both the English and Spanish versions of these high-interest comprehension passages.  Parents will be able to help their students at home, and students will feel more included in what they’re reading about.  Even if students cannot read Spanish, the language support that parents can provide to them at home will help them to develop both their language and comprehension skills.\n\nYour support in this project will allow many frustrated readers to experience success, which is what will ultimately drive them to become true readers.  No student should miss out on the experience of reading and enjoying a good book, and mine will find much easier access to this experience with access these resources."

I am sure you have heard the saying ""variety is the spice of life"", that phrase describes my students. They are identified as high achievers in different areas of the curriculum spanning grades 1-5.  Their classes with me are combined by grade levels. Grades 1, 2, and 3 are taught together on one day and grades 4 and 5 are taught on another day.  I serve students in two rural elementary schools in our county.\n \n\nMy students do not have textbooks.  By providing a subscription for each student, which addresses their  own grade level, they will be able to broaden their knowledge base of other cultures and current events.  The students will be able to take their magazines into their homes and share them with their families, which will impact an even larger group of learners. \n\nYour support of this project will benefit my students as well as their siblings and parents. The key to the success of every student is the amount of support at home. Your donation will give the parents another tool with which to read to and with their students. Your support will benefit not only my students in the classroom setting,but will allow them to take the information into their homes. "

Our classroom is filled with reading and writing, but some need an artistic outlet for their self-expression. \n\nOur school is a school that focuses on the whole child. Students are involved daily in inquiry based projects and learning, but often do not have the proper supplies to drive their inquiry deeper. I have 26 third grade students who are learning to love writing and reading, but I would like to introduce them to the love of artistic expression through the use of simple graphite pencils, a globe, and an easel. My students are enthusiastic about learning and will be thrilled to have these supplies to learn more about art and artists. \n\nIn a testing driven realm, these art supplies will allow students to delve into their inner selves in a way they have not had the opportunity previously. They will be able to learn to draw with the proper equipment instead of their regular writing pencils.  This will give the students a way to express themselves in a new and exciting way. I love pencil drawing and want to teach them that it is a great way to relax and express their emotions. \n\nStudents spend too much time with technological media and do not take the time to reflect quietly. By introducing them to drawing, they will have the means to learn to listen to the world around them, draw what they hear and learn to love simple things. I am very excited about teaching them to love art and to take the time to be still and reflect on themselves, their learning, and their dreams. "

Like many 10 year olds, they have trouble working with fractions in math class. Many of my students come from parents who did not finish school, so they lack parental homework help at home. I am blessed to have access to technology at my school. We have a computer lab in which we schedule time for students to practice skills with computer programs. However, the computer program only recognizes a multiple choice answer and does not diagnose the problem.

Let The Music Play,"Do you remember what it was like to listen to Music and wish that you could play an instrument?

Cases we have are duct taped and bungie cord tied. Music = JOY  ,"Do you remember what it was like to listen to Music and wish that you could play an instrument? Even video game designers know how much fun, joy and pleasure guitars can be - Guitar Hero has been a huge hit. However, nothing can replace an authentic true to life Real Musical Instrument.  \n\nOver 1/2 our students receive free and reduced lunch meaning their homes are categorized as moderate poverty. This however, does not affect the curiosity and interest they are learning within our Music program. Many have never even touched a musical instrument until they come to school. At our school, our students are given the opportunity in 5th grade to have guitar lessons for 9 weeks. This allows all 5th graders to have lessons throughout the year. They love it! Our terrific Music program would not be a success without our dedicated Music director. He truly inspires all my students year after year. There is no better feeling than when a student returns to our school and lets us know that they are in Honors Bands, Marching Bands or just continuing their love for Music. Because of lack of funding in schools, our Arts programs could be removed. This would be huge mistake. So of course to even suggest to our district that cases are needed would probably not be wise.  \n\nSchool should be a place for all children to look forward to each day. Sad as it is, some of our students have home lives that are not rewarding. While economic circumstances can cause some of this, children should still be allowed to be kids, to learn new things and for all to feel that they are important and can learn. Music is such a great way for students to learn that there are other things in life than can bring pleasure and joy. For this reason, I would love for my students to be able to practice what they are learning in Music class. We do not have enough cases for our guitars to be taken home. The cases we do have include some with missing handles making it near impossible for a child to carry the case when the case is larger than the student. Others are duct taped or wrapped with bungi cords. I want my students to enjoy the art of playing music. I want them to be able to feel good in an activity that takes focus and practice. This could make a difference in a child's success. \n\nBy allowing my students to gain a love for Music, you will be offering them a lifelong gift. Our Music teacher takes the time with all 5th graders and shows them what joy can come from a GUITAR.  What we learn in our youth can help mold us into our adult life. Lessons taught to child can encourage them that no matter what their circumstances away from school may be, they can succeed. Practice makes perfect and these cases will allow students to practice at home and share this with parents! "

My students are visual learners.  They love pictures, they look books with pictures and they love photos of their families, their neighborhood and their friends. \n\nAs a counselor, I know that students with ties to the community are more likely to succeed because the community helps the student (and his/her family) to succeed.

English Language Development is next, followed by Math instruction then small group intervention time. \n\nOur school is 95% English Language Learners with about 85% on free lunch. Very few of these children have access to computers in the home. This in itself makes technology in our classroom all the more important. We are a suburb of a large city and gang activity is very prominent in our neighborhood. At the beginning of the year 60% of our students were assessed at the intensive reading level (2 years below grade level). A large majority of our parents speak only Spanish in the home, therefore, they have less skills to help our students be successful with school work. Our school's goal is for students to embrace reading which will move them toward being successful in high school and then on to college. Our students are encouraged to use the school library to check out books, and take Reading Counts Test as often as possible to improve these same skills. \n\nThe children will work with the ipads during small group center time, on reading apps and Internet web sites to build their reading skills. Students will be able to find Informational text as well as good literature examples to build their fluency, comprehension and listening skills. During small group reading rotations, students will use ipads to support the Common Core Standards being introduced during the week. The ipads will put information at their finger tips to support and meet the learning needs of each child. Also, ipads will be used to support science and social studies lessons by providing research on the Internet in these subjects areas. Being able to use the ipads on the Internet with science and social studies support their learning, answer questions, and guide their understanding of the world around them. Students will go on virtual field trips since most students have limited access to places such as museums, libraries, etc. beyond the city in which they live. \n\nMy students have limited access to technology. Adding ipads to the classroom will provide them additional ways to learn skills in diverse way. Technology gives students the ability to interact at their individual learning levels and encourages them to improve while making learning exciting. This in turn makes the student feel more successful on individual tasks. As a classroom teacher, I can track their individual progress and be able to report this progress to parents more succinctly.

I am trying to open my students eyes to things to do by introducing them to exciting and captivating books.  The students here in a little town in Kentucky have an eager energy to learn.  Since our school is a very high poverty area funding is cut short and used in the necessity areas, which means new novels seem to get cut. \n\nHaving this book to teach to my students will allow me to show my students they are fighting for something.

We start our theme with a great book and let the learning blossom from there! \n\nOur district is spread between two small towns.  The students are mainly children of farming families.  We also have a large Native American population.  For the most part, the students are well behaved and love to learn about new things.  Many of the students come from struggling families, and don't have much support at home with their education.  I tend to try to send the students home with homework that they can complete on their own. The district does provide the basics for us to the best of their ability, but many of our materials are getting so old, that we are running very low.  The students have already read all the books in our class sets this year, and they are hungry for new titles!  I have been amazed at the level of enthusiasm they have demonstrated while learning about each new topic.  We are a small school but have lots of spirit!  We enjoy the journey that a great book can provide! \n\nI have requested 3 chapter book titles in class set size.  The first one is Ida B.  I decided on this book because I read it with my daughter, who happens to be the same age as my students, and she LOVED it!  I think this book will be a great tool for sparking the imagination of my students and leading them onto other topics to discover.  The second book is called Freaky Friday.  I decided on this book because it is an entertaining book and I think it will promote some great creative thinking for writing.  The third title is, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas.  This book is very emotional, but I picked it because they loved Number the Stars, by Lowes Lowery so much!  I think this book would be a great addition to our library.  In addition to the books, I also got to audio books.  We will use these to practice fluency.  Many of our students struggle with vocabulary, from lack of exposer, so hearing the story helps a great deal.  We will use each book to meet the state standards! \n\nThis project is important to me because I know what these kids are missing!  This is my first year in this small district.  I taught the last 10 years in a 6A school, and had a plethora of materials at my fingertips.  Kids should have the same opportunities when it comes to public education.  I just want to open the world to these students for the short time they are with me.  Maybe I will inspire them to take a new path in life, in addition to becoming excellent readers! "

In addition, if they could see how wonderful they look it would boast their self-esteem even more-because they could see how  they are doing the positions correctly. We dance in socks, and do floor exercises on the cafeteria tables because the floor is way too sticky! We don't care about that, but the mirrors would be a great help. I could mount them to the walls of the cafeteria, which I think would be an added laugh for the kids at lunch. I could just see them all making faces in the mirror!\n\nYour help will ensure that the students are learning the classics which are so important to a student's education. I noticed that when Swan Lake started playing in the auditorium, everyone sat up and listened. It's powerful music and very compelling. It demands attention. It was very different music for them. Looking beautiful and being accomplished as a ballet dancer on the stage is like a dream come true for a little girl and that's what I hope to give them-a dream come true."

Their eagerness and capacity to learn history each day is only outpaced by their knowledge of ever-changing technology. \n\nMy students are creative, interesting, and driven. They are enrolled in our school's visual art academy, which means they take one art class per year and their academic classes have an arts focus. They have incredible artistic visions that I do my best to tap into the classroom. Because they primarily come from low-income families in inner-city neighborhoods, my students do not have much by way of technology. Many of them do not have a computer at home. \n\nIt's scary sometimes as a teacher when your students know more than you. While I am able to share what I know about history, they are teaching me all kinds of things about technology. Through them I have learned that my resources at school are limited - my students need a high-tech laptop to turn their amazing ideas into reality. \n\nAt the end of each unit, students conduct research on a related topic of choice and then present their research in a creative format. Students have created power points, poster boards, drawings, and more. Many of them want to create movies or animated sideshows, but our current technology does not allows this. A MacBook, with programs like iMovie, will enable students to present their research in a more engaging format. \n\nWhile only one computer, this MacBook will enable many of my students to create the products they so far can only dream about. It will also give them much needed skills, as Apple products are an industry standard in the visual arts. "

They are eager to learn and to use technology to explore and show what they know. \n\nMy students are wonderful.  They come from homes where they don't have a lot of access to the Internet or to technology.  They are old enough to know a little bit about what is possible with technology, but it is out of reach for them, and that makes them frustrated.  They want to learn how to use technology to find information, learn, and create in incredible ways.  \n\nMy students come from low-income households and about 75% of them are English Language Learners.  They are highly at-risk for being drawn into gangs.  I have them in third grade, and I feel a strong responsibility to spark their love of learning and encourage them to make good choices, because choices can have life-long effects. \n\nI'm asking for a Samsung Chromebook to help students access information and programs online.  This is just one project. I'm hoping to build a collection so that I can have groups working together on learning projects.  I'm also asking for headphones and splitters so that several children can work and listen together on a project.\n\nThis technology will be used for all subject areas.  Students can use them to read and write, to practice their math skills, and explore themes and topics in science and social studies.  The applications are endless.  There is so much they can do to help them learn.   \n\nMy project is important because the face of education is changing.  We are moving away from students being passive learners, sitting in a chair and being talked to by a teacher.  We are moving towards active learners, where teachers provide the tools, the safe environment, and the guidance to explore and learn at a deeper level.  These tools will help my students in amazing ways.  Thank you for your consideration and time, and if you can't give, that's okay but please share and encourage others. "
"Sitting Pretty, Sitting Safe  - Part Two","My room is furnished with very old, unsafe student desks.   The sad thing is that on two occasions where I lost desks last year, students were actually sitting in them at the time they fell apart.",My students need 4 desks.,"\nYou will find our middle school situated in a beautiful, rural part of Carolina. We have evolved from a tobacco farming community into a bedroom suburb. Housing developments have replaced the tobacco fields. With the influx of new families comes overcrowding and deficiencies in the classroom.\n\nEvery year, teachers and administrators send out emails for ""extra desks."" It is sad. We have none. Janitorial staff go school to school looking for desks and we have even gone to the local community college, gathering their discarded desks. My room is furnished with very old, unsafe student desks. Last year, I started with 28 desks, but am currently down to 22.  Several students sit at a borrowed, double desk and occasionally, students sit isolated at a large materials table in the back of the room. The sad thing is that on two occasions where I lost desks last year, students were actually sitting in them at the time they fell apart. The students were not being abusive. One student was a larger athlete while the other was a petite, young lady. The condition of the desks are such that they are not safe for anyone to sit in. My heart just sinks when in the middle of class, a desk collapses.\n\nAnother issue impacting instruction are the sizes of the desks. They are too small for seventh graders.  I uploaded a picture to illustrate what I am describing.  Larger students are not comfortable and the desk will barely hold an open textbook. During any given class period, students also need notebooks, calculators, clickers, pencils and manipulatives.  Every single class is interrupted multiple times by calculators and personal response remotes (clickers) crashing on the floor.  LCD and solar panels are constantly being broken. Replacements, while necessary, are very expensive. \n\nWhile you may not be able to donate a classroom of desks, maybe you could help us get four.  I am submitting six separate proposals for four desks each.  The goal is to eventually get a new desk for every child in the class. I realize that while this may never happen, it well might.  The generosity of donors is quite amazing.\n\nThank you for your consideration and support.\n\n"
Come On In and Have a Seat!,I believe the solution to this problem is to get a new carpet for my classroom.  The carpet that I have chosen for my classroom measures over 8' by 13'!,My students need a comfortable and educational carpet to sit on.,"Being able to pay attention is one of the most important aspects of a child being able to learn!  I am a first grade teacher in a poverty stricken neighborhood and I enjoy nothing more than seeing the satisfaction on a child's face when he/she has learned the concepts I have been teaching!  Teaching itself is the reward in this career.  Although it can be challenging to work with students who have behavior and/or attention problems, I feel that I am able to make a difference in the lives of these children. \n\nI believe one of the best ways to teach children, especially children who have difficulty paying attention, is to bring them close to the teacher.  I always introduce important concepts and lessons by bringing my students to the carpet.  There, they are able to focus on what I am teaching them.  The front carpet is where I teach important lessons such as blending sounds into words, how to make a pattern, how to tell time, how to plant seeds, and other fun activities.  However, I am trying to teach these wonderful lessons on a scrap carpet that was donated to me by a carpet warehouse that was about to throw it away.  The carpet measures no bigger than 6' by 8'.  It is very difficult to fit 19 to 24 growing, squiggling little first grade bodies on a carpet that is so small.  Although students have the choice to sit around the carpet instead of directly on it, the hard floor is uncomfortable and does not provide an adequate learning environment for my students to learn as much as they can. \n\nI believe the solution to this problem is to get a new carpet for my classroom.  The carpet that I have chosen for my classroom measures over 8' by 13'!  This will definitely provide enough room for each of my students to have their own personal space!  This will give the students a chance to focus on my lesson, instead of the elbows in their ribs, or knees in their backs.  This also allows students to spread out and limit the amount of chatting that can sometimes happen when students are in very close proximity with their best friend!  However, I have not chosen just any ordinary big carpet.  I believe that I can get even more out of a front room carpet.  The carpet that I have chosen has many crucial lessons for first graders!  The carpet has all of the days of the week printed on it, as well as all of the months of the year.  This is one of the most important math objectives first grade students learn.  In fact, the carpet itself can be used as a calendar!  Teaching these important lessons during calendar time can be greatly enhanced simply by using the carpet they are sitting on.  I can already think of fun games I could do with the carpet, choosing volunteers, etc!  \n\nThis carpet would definitely be a wonderful asset and blessing to my classroom.  It is a wonderful tool to help teach students the hard concepts of time.  Most importantly, it will provide students with their own space to learn.  They will be able to focus on the lessons I am teaching, and not worry about the threads sticking out of the carpet.  However, this can only become a reality with your help and generosity. With your donation, I will be able to provide the future generation a comfortable place to learn all of the crucial lessons taught in first grade, such as how to read and adding and subtracting.  Thank you so much for reading and please consider supporting a wonderful project!  "

What is a push or a pull? Who is that Newton Guy?  Help my students discover these concepts!,"ÂÂYou don'ÂÂt throw a whole life away just because its banged up a little"" ÂÂ""Seabiscuit. My students have overcome obstacles to be able to focus on learning and then teaching, science concepts to grades K-8 at the local library monthly for Science Saturday. Supplies are needed to continue this program. \n\nThe students at the Charter School of San Diego are independent study students who are determined to succeed.  Many of our students are here to focus on the education portion of school, without the disruption of the daily social aspects.  That being said, there was a need within our community to a science program to be developed that would encourage students in K-8 to learn and experience science on a monthly basis.  Working closely with the students, ""Science Saturday"" was developed, which is a once-a-month program where our students volunteer to teach science to their younger counterparts.  Research has shown that service learning can increase students' personal, interpersonal and social development, increase motivation, student engagement and school attendance and lead to new perspectives and a better lifestyle choices and behavior. I've witnessed firsthand the growth of my students, both academically and personally and would like to be able to create a sustainable program. \n\nThe resources requested will allow my students to learn about simple machines, but more importantly, these interactive models and displays will ensure that they are able to teach these concepts to their younger counterparts.  My high school students are better educators when they are able to visually showcase their knowledge and have items to move, manipulate and help create to demonstrate the point they are attempting to make. In addition, with the paper and boards they will be able to make visual displays for the participants to read and interact with and handouts for parents and students, in case they would like to know more about the program and the science they are learning.  By purchasing supplies that are not disposable, this program will be able to create a sustainable base for future students, taking this student-led program and allowing it to continue for future classes.  These resources will allow these students to experience the joy of science and community service! \n\nInteractive models that allow students to explore a concept in a relevant manner is critical to a strong science education.  Therefore, the models and supports for simple machines will allow wide range of students and ages, to explore how machines make our lives easier.  The basic school supplies will allow my students to make displays and organize their materials.  Remember when you were astounded when a wheelbarrow was a machine?  Help my students discover simple machines!! "
Help Us See Our Work in Print,"We need a basic, black and white printer for the classroom. I would allow students to print only final drafts of classwork, in order to save paper and toner.",My students need a printer in our classroom so that they can turn in typed projects and papers even if they don't have a printer at home.,"I will be teaching 7th grade English and Social Studies next year, after three years as the librarian at our school. I am so excited about being a classroom teacher -- I have many ideas for projects and lessons, but need to gather the resources and technology to make them possible. Our school is an urban, high-poverty middle school with many needs and little money for tools and supplies. Many of our students face challenges at home and in school; more than 70 percent qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, and many do not have computers, Internet access, or printers at home. \n\nI think it is important that students be able to type and print their work, at least some of the time. I plan to do several projects next year where students need to print -- for example, a social justice project where they will examine a problem in our neighborhood and then type letters to the editor of our city's newspaper. Since not all have their own computers and printers, I am always aware of these equity issues and the digital divide, and I will be sensitive about not requiring typed work unless we have computer lab time to complete it. However, some students do type their assignments at home and then want to print it. The printer in the library is not always available, so it would be wonderful if they could use one in my classroom. I would also love to be able to print handouts without running up to the library or the computer lab. \n\nWe need a basic, black and white printer for the classroom. I would allow students to print only final drafts of classwork, in order to save paper and toner. It will also make it easier for my students to hand in their work on time and in a format that is easy to read and correct. \n\nYou will make it possible for students to turn in word processed documents even if they do not have a printer at home. They will learn computer skills and also take more pride in their work. A classroom printer seems like a basic need; unfortunately my school cannot afford to provide a working printer to each teacher. It would be wonderful to have one and would make life so much easier for me and for my students."

They are kind, empathetic, thoughtful and overall just a fantastic group of kids.  Sure, we have our third grade 'girl drama' about who is sitting next to who at lunch and 'she's mad at me!' but they all have their own sparkling personalities.  They attend an average school, many are on 'free and reduced' lunch, many have one-parent households or have experienced divorce, etc.  We have a wide spectrum of students, those who put in a lot of effort and care about their success in school and then those who just get through the day.  They are a very genuine group of kids! \n\nThe Scholastic magazines are aligned to the Common Core and touch on many different aspects of learning for the students.  Not only will they become more familiar with non-fiction text, but they will learn how to form opinions, solve problems and become more informed students overall due to the text they are being exposed to.  We will be able to do extension activities based on what we are reading and hopefully even have students inspired through some of the stories they read.   \n\nIf we are able to receive enough donations to fund our need for nonfiction text, my students would be supplied with high interest nonfiction text for an entire school year.  I would also make it a large focus that generous and willing people are to thank for our magazines.  By drawing attention to our donors' generosity each month we receive our magazines it will show them how important reading is to others as well as show an example of true generosity!   "

Their learning increases exponentially with their experiences in my classroom. \n\nWhen we receive these cars we will be able to do different labs that enable the students to internalize their learning.  We can experience inertia and the relationship of mass and motion, find the variables that impact acceleration and velocity, and many other activities.  The students will be able to see the Laws of Motion in action. \n\nHaving the matchbox cars will impact my students' learning tremendously.

We discuss why it is important to keep electronic equipment clean not only for the life of the item but also the safety of the user(s).\n\nAlthough I work hard with the help of my students to eliminate dust and dirt, I have found the best cleaning utensil to be a vacuum with attachments. It allows for dust and dirt to be trapped (rather than spreading around the room); it also allows for intense cleaning around the many cords that accompany computers. Vacuuming lessens the need for cleaning. The students are always willing to do their lessons and go the extra step to keep their computer lab clean. \n\nA vacuum (with attachments) is necessary and beneficial to the equipment. Previously, I had brought a vacuum from home that we used often and to the delight of the kids. They loved watching the thick dust disappear making the cords and equipment look like new.

The edges have started to fray and the binding has now started coming off and the area that the binding was attached to is now falling off and is all over the floor. \n\nI am asking for a new carpet to be used during the day. This carpet will help my students feel free in our room and not stuck behind a desk all day. This carpet will help my students identify the letters of the alphabet and letter sounds.

However, one of the standards on which my 3rd, 4th and 5th grade students must be assessed is ""Reading and Notating Music."" \n\nMy 51-year-old moderate poverty elementary school is in a very diverse neighborhood. We have over 30 nationalities represented among our 650 students. The staff and PTA parents are actively involved in the community and the school, and continually seek opportunities to enrich our students. Our biggest challenge is a lack of adequate funding because we do not qualify for federal assistance (we are not a Title I school), but we also do not have many wealthy families who can donate to the school. \n\nThe Note Knacks system guides students to master this challenge through hands-on learning. Not only will they learn how to read the musical rhythms, they will understand how to manipulate combinations of rhythms to fit in a measure of music! \n\nBy regrouping the color coded Note Knacks manipulatives, the students will learn the fundamental building blocks of music while simultaneously improving their math skills. They will also use higher level thinking skills as they create, evaluate, and analyze their music. \n\nMy students need kinesthetic, hands-on, concrete (not abstract) manipulatives to learn note lengths, duration, rhythm, and meter. Your donation will provide the tools for them to use experiential learning to master the music standard of demonstrating an awareness of rhythmic concepts and the standards of reading and notating music. This optimum level of learning will occur if the students have the necessary tools. Will you help our children by donating the hands-on manipulatives they need? "

The stereotype that girls are not good at science/math is a hard one to overcome. ""The Evolution of Calpurnia Tate"" challenges this stereotype! \n\nMy students are generally interested in science because they get to do hands on activities and other experiments. They attend a good school, with a science lab, and teachers who take pride in leading them through experiments. However, there is always something holding back my girls. There is a stereotype out there that girls are not talented in math and science. I wish to challenge this stereotype and show/inspire my girls to not only enjoy science but follow their natural curiosity into a career. Usually, when the science concepts get difficult to follow my girls are the first ones to quit. They give up very easily and use the excuse of Ã¢ÂÂthis is grossÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂm more of a readerÃ¢ÂÂ to get out of the work.  By reading the book I wish to provide them with a role model to follow into the world of exploration. By reading about other girls who found a fascinating world in science, hopefully they will be encouraged to do the same... both the the classroom and at home! \n\nI'm asking for a classroom of books, paperback, so it's cheap... and an audio/CD book to compliment this set. That's it! We will read the book over the course of a few weeks, the kids will each have a chapter to on which to report, and as a class we will share the book together! Plus, each student will be required to do an individual book talk in addition to the report on their individual chapter. Together, we will read and experience the book and report on it together. The extension to this activity will be to report on famous FEMALE scientist in history and to use technology to research and present this information. \n\nThis is important to my students because I see women in science careers every day but my students donÃ¢ÂÂt see this. By allowing my students, specifically my girls, the chance to read about an 11 year old girl who discovers a whole new world of science in her own backyard,  perhaps they will be inspired to start exploring on their own and follow this sense of wonder into a career someday.

Sometimes, I can't address each student's needs with the resources I have. At times, I may go above the heads of some.  At other times, I may bore others. \n\nMy students are from all over the world and mostly from socioeconomically stressed families.  My newcomers usually come from third world countries like the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, Bangladesh and Albania.  My US born students mostly come from economically depressed urban areas that may also be ethnic enclaves.  I consider many of them ESL because they don't speak or hear English at home or in their community. \n\nEven with all their baggage, they still have one of the highest attendance rates in our area.  They all have their fun quirks, interests, gifts and needs.  We all work and learn at a small public school with limited funds and limited space.  Class sizes are high.  Resources are limited. \n\nDue to the lack of funding and space, we have 5 operational laptop carts to share among the 35 teachers' classes.  There is only one classroom with desktops.  I have one laptop that I use in my lessons.  Whenever I am not actively using my laptop, I may offer it to a student who needs a little review or to another student who can research a related content topic for enrichment.  Having an iPhone at home, my two young children utilize the educational apps on it and are really engaged while I can attend to other matters.  I thought I could really address two issues of differentiation in my classes and utilizing innovative educational apps by getting a couple of iPad minis. \n\nI think back to when I was a student.  I've had times where the level of instruction is too high and too low and that's a perfect time to check out mentally.  I would love to increase my students' interaction and engagement with educational material so that they can ""check out"" less and feel a greater sense of understanding and achievement. "

Currently, I am loaning students my own personal bass and amplifier.","Our school has faced a major budget setback and our students started the school year without any musical instruments. We have been playing songs on ukuleles obtained on Donorschoose, but need a steady musical backbone to our interpretation of popular and folk songs. \n\nThe students are 7th and 8th grade students at a highly urban public charter school in California. About 75 percent of the students are on the free or reduced lunch program. Over 90 percent of the students are minority students as well. While they have taken once a week piano lessons in the last school year, they have not played any other instruments other than small percussion instruments. \n\nThe electric bass will allow students to have a steady beat and backbone for our twice a year performance in front of the school community. I currently loan my personal instruments to my students so that they are able to have a complete popular music sound instead of just ukuleles and voices. By including the electric bass in the program, the school will finally own an electric bass that can provide students with a complete group sound. \n\nMusic is a gift that lasts a lifetime. This bass can open pathways for popular, folk, rock, and stepping stones for other genres. This can be the difference for at risk students in a highly urban setting. Please help impact students. Music and the arts are a stepping stone for the creative and critical thinking minds of the future. "

They are very smart and hard working, and love to come to school! They do need some extra things to help them in the classroom, though, and since we are at a Title I school, there isn't a lot of extra money lying around. \n\nWe were able to get an Epson printer from lots of generous donors last year, which was awesome! The only problem is that the ink is expensive. We print out a lot of things in our classroom, like visuals to help with speech development, so we burn through ink pretty quickly. These visuals are essential for my kids' learning, and many times are the difference between a day that runs smoothly and a day filled with meltdowns. It's so frustrating when you can't communicate, especially when you could have just used pictures! \n\nThere are so many pictures we need that I jot down throughout the day, and when we had ink, I sat down at the end of the day to print them out. Now the list is getting longer and longer, and we've had to make do with what we have (which does not always work). It would be wonderful if we could print in our classroom again! My kids would once again have what they need to maximize their potential for learning. "

This is the question that we often face at carpet time. We have a great big space for carpet time but the students are confused on where to sit when there are no ""spots"" or visuals on the carpet. \n\nWe are a full day Kindergarten class! We are also a very large Pre-K through third grade elementary school in Oklahoma. We love to move, share, and have fun while learning. We are very active and spend a lot of time on the carpet getting to know our peers, singing songs, reading stories and so much more. Whole group time is a vital part of Kindergarten education. \n\nWe are asking for a large rug with color squares for each child to sit on. Each student will have their own defined space on the carpet. The ""carpet"" currently is our normal classroom flooring. If we have a carpet with assigned color squares for each student, they will be able to have their own space to sit and learn. We will spend less time managing our bodies at carpet time and more time learning. It is really important to establish good routines and procedures in early childhood classrooms. With a rug made for this purpose, students will know the specific routines of where to go when I ask them to go to carpet time. Classroom management is one of the most important parts of our day and this rug will make a huge improvement in the time we spend managing the kids. We will be able to spend more time focused on our learning. \n\nThis is a rug that we can use from year to year. We will make a positive impact on all students that come through our classroom door when we have good management. Our goal is to provide the best education we can for every student that comes through our door and a rug will be a great resource in this endeavor. Thank you for choosing to further the education of our students! "

They seem so young to me, and I really expected more from them in terms of reading and writing ability. The advantage of teaching them for two years, however, is that I know where they need to be at the end of their 8th grade year, and with this group in particular, I feel they have a great distance to go.  I feel they are quite able to meet the challenges I want to provide for them, so I would like to add this new dimension and more books to the current curriculum. \n\nThis 7th grade English class is an academically diverse group.  Some of my students read at the 10th grade level, while others struggle at the 4th grade level.  I need to find materials of interest for all students, while integrating English and social studies. The Dust Bowl/Poetry integrated unit is coming up and I find that there are not enough books for the whole class to use.  They were not included in the budget.\n\nTo complete this unit, we need copies of Karen Hesse's Out of the Dust to read as part of a unit on poetry which is being integrated with a social studies unit about the Dust Bowl.  This book is written in poetic verse and is a good illustration of how poetry can narrate stories as well as create images. The Teacher's Guide may offer good suggestions beyond my own plans.\n\nWith your help I can get the 15 additional copies of ""Out of the Dust"" so that each student will have his/her own book to take home to complete assignments during this poetry and social studies unit.

A good flip book made from card stock can be just like a mini movie. We have made life cycle of plants flip books, but on regular printing paper but they did not flip so well. I know we can do better with card stock.  \n\nWe are an inner city K-8 elementary school in a very high poverty area of a large metropolitan school district. The majority of my students (85%) are English Language Learners and first generation Americans. Our free lunch status is around 95% or higher. My teaching position is one of a resource or specialist teacher who serves over 650 students throughout the school year. This is a science class for the entire elementary school.  \n\nWith a supply of card stock paper, students will benefit from make-and-take projects. Science concepts and themes such as life cycles and change processes literally come to life with flip book resources. It is also important to note that these flip books are a way to get science into the homes of many students.  \n\nMany of my students do not have science materials at home. Many students do not have visual science resources that they can call their own. These materials will bring numerous fun and informative science books into the students' hands. "

I try to incorporate technology into my curriculum every chance I can get, but budget cuts can make that really difficult.  \n\nI recently got funded for a netbook, which has been such an amazing addition to my classroom. The kids practically beg for time to play games, surf the net, read and practice typing. This new laptop will let me download a program my school recently purchased for academic intervention that can only be used on regular size computers.  \n\nThis program, once installed on the laptop, will enable me to track student progress and assign content areas in need of intervention. To have access to this in my classroom will allow many of my at risk students extra time for academic support.  "

I teach math and extended learning to your typical middle school student. Often students like to staple their work together before they turn it in. I have had to fix my current stapler numerous times this school year. It has almost become a game to some of the students. \n\nI think if I had a heavy duty stapler students would be able to secure their materials and projects better. I also think it would increase the efficiency of the line to staple things by having a spare stapler for students to use. Unfortunately items don't last like they use to and that is why I am asking for a heavy duty stapler. \n\nA new stapler might seem crazy to many, but it would be helpful for the students to have a reliable one to use in the future. Please consider improving the classroom setting with something as simple as a stapler. Thanks! "

Show me, I'll remember. Involve me, I'll understand."" This Chinese proverb sheds light on the challenges facing my students.  The struggle of a self-contained special education classroom severely lacking hands-on materials necessary to teach students crucial daily living skills. \n\nMy students are some of the most wonderful young people with the biggest hearts you will ever meet. Most of them have overcome challenges by age 8 or 9 that you and I couldn't think of overcoming in our entire lifetime. They are eager, honest, compassionate, strong-willed, courageous, and are all identified with some form of severe intellectual or cognitive disability. However, none of my students let their disability define who they are. They enjoy being with their peers as much as possible. Music, P.E., and lunch are some of their favorite times throughout the day. Three of my students are completely non-verbal--two of them utilize iPads to communicate their needs and wants. Our low-income Title1 school services all students identified with intellectual disabilities who are unable to function in the general education or resource special education rooms throughout the entire district. My self-contained classroom provides almost one-to-one teacher(para-educator) support student ratios. \n\nMy students work incredibly hard to build relationships with their peers, be involved in school and community projects, and be as independent as possible. There are many things you and I take for granted each day. These simple tasks are some of the goals my students focus on daily. Something as easy as ordering a hamburger from McDonald's can take years for my kids to master--more basic is just knowing that a stove-top is hot and shouldn't be touched, some food goes in a fridge, other foods are heated in a microwave and what are the appropriate ways to eat certain foods. In addition, my students find it incredibly difficult to button, snap, and/or lace clothing. One of our main goals is to have our students recognize what clothes to wear when & the process of getting dressed--ultimately,have our students be independent in their daily living tasks (self-help, hygiene, grooming, eating etc.) so that they can function as part of a community in and outside of the school environment.  \n\nDue to the social & language deficits my students have, self-reliant skills have to be explicitly taught. Research shows us it is imperative to actually place the object in the child's hands and guide them through each step of the task using a hand-over-hand manual method of instruction.  It's that ""Involve me,I understand"" component. Having the materials outlined in this project would aid in making my kids less reliant on those around them, more independent,&allow them to integrate into society. "

These students will soon be jettisoned out of our safe environment of elementary school and into a large urban high school.  The more I can reinforce and  encourage them to use the habits learned in this book and the accompanying workbook, the more chance the students  have to make wise choices when they leave our school in the spring.   Right now, when I ask them to take out the text of The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Teens, they enthusiastically say, ""Yes!""  These books have exercises for the students to practice called baby steps.  One student recently chose to complete a baby step where he asked his dad if they could buy a hamburger for a homeless man.  He wrote how good he felt about this and also was glad that his two little brothers were able to witness how happy the man was when they presented him with food.  This workbook would provide other opportunities, suggestions, and ideas to reinforce these seven habits and hopefully, the students will remember them for a life time.\n\n\n"

They use these language skills to hone their Spanish, they make connections between their home language and Spanish, and they appreciate the value of communicating with everyone in our community, not just English speakers. \n\nWith a folding table, I have the occasional space I need for a mobile museum. The museum exhibit might be Molas from the San Blas Islands of Panama, with art supplies displayed next to them so that students can create their own Molas. The exhibit might be authentic Ofrendas and Calacas for Day of the Dead, with the goal of students making their own Calacas to display the following days. No trip to a museum is complete without a little snack. When I make a Paella with Spanish 4 students, we need a place to prepare our ingredients. Spanish 2 students take a virtual vacation to a Spanish-speaking country. One of the best parts of this unit is the potluck that follows. After having researched and studied a particular country, then making a PowerPoint and presenting to the class everything that s/he did on vacation (in the past tense of course!), the Spanish 2 students bring in a meal from their ""country"" that they have prepared. How wonderful to have a potluck with an actual table! \n\nI like to make the curriculum joyful and full of interesting experiences: singing songs, doing art, dialogs and plays with props, and activities with realia that I bring from home. I stay more organized and on-task if I don't have to worry where my materials are, if everyone can access them, and I'm more likely to enhance the lesson with extras if I have somewhere to put them.

Many students will also read the books every night at home for multiple hours. \n\nOur students have been begging me to get them interesting on-level books to read. The books I have chosen for this grant are immensely popular! Students have been repeatedly asking me for books by the renown teen literature author Walter Dean Meyers. Myers has a box set that we have requested for this grant and a number of additional popular titles including ""Monster"" and ""Handbook for Boys"". These books will keep our high-energy students engaged and learning into the difficult summer months. Good books go a long way to helping students succeed! \n \n\nPlease help us provide our students with the engaging ideas in these popular books! I have bought numerous books on my own but a teacher's salary doesn't give enough room for the kind of philanthropy that our kids desperately need. \n\nPlease help us by providing these essential resources for our wonderful students! \nWe thank you for your continuing support for our cause. The betterment of our students is the betterment of our world. Thank you and god bless!\n "

All it takes is the gift of books. \n\nI am a speech/language/reading therapist working with preschoolers who attend Headstart, as well as elementary students in grades kindergarten through third grade. My students have significant delays across reading and language skills.  Most of them come from extremely economically disadvantaged homes. Many of them have few or no books at home. Some come to their first day of school without ever having a book read to them. How can you possibly develop good reading skills when you have had very little exposure to books at home? \n\nAll of my lessons are centered around children's literature.  We  spend several weeks reading and re-reading a story to learn new vocabulary words, provide exposure to new ideas/places, develop critical thinking skills, improve oral expression, and have fun!!  In order to further enhance the learning process, I would love to be able to send home copies of the books that I read.  These would be books that my children could keep forever.  They could share what they have learned with their families. The book could be read to them over and over again at home resulting in additional development of reading skills. This would also foster quality bonding time with their caregivers, which is sorely lacking with many of these kids. An added bonus would be that these families would now have a collection of books that could also be shared with future children helping to continue to inspire the love of reading for generations to come! \n\nIn the past, I have spent my own money to send books home with my babies. Their responses made me feel like I had given them a treasure of gold!  They were so overjoyed to get a book that they could keep forever!  I knew my dollars were spent well when they came to school the next day and said, ""Miss Sharon, my mama read that book to me!""   "

Most of my students have not. They often see reading as a chore and don't really read for fun. This project hopes to change all of this by giving them an engaging and hands on unit on the book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. \n\nThe students I teach are 90% Hispanic, with the remainder being African American, all of whom live in poverty or just above the poverty line. Many come from single parent homes, or from homes where parents don't work. They struggle to make ends meet and many kids in the neighborhood drop out before graduating from high school.\n\nMy students are middle schoolers, who are looking for direction in a world that is ready to leave them behind.\n\nThe school is located in the inner city in an area that is full of drug use and gang violence. The children see this every day and are influenced by it. They see it and think it is the way to a better future. Many of our students want to do well and have big dreams but everyone constantly tells them they can't do it because of where they come from.\n\nThey often don't have access to the materials they need to take themselves to the next level of learning. Most don't have books in their homes and don't have access to a library close by. \n\nMy students need to read books on their level and need to enjoy their reading. I can't think of a better book to do this than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. \n\nThe book is entertaining for children and relatively easy to read so that all of my students would be able to read it.\n\nWith the story go many different activities and discussions. The biggest one will be the study of chocolate in the classroom. While reading the book students will also learn about the history of and the making of chocolate. They will watch videos and do research on chocolate. Students will also be able to taste test many different kinds and brands of chocolate and write about their experiences doing so.\n\nThe idea is to take the story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and branch out in many different directions, tying in science, social studies, art, and writing. Students will be engaged and interested in what they are doing, inspiring them to read and to become lifelong learners. My students need the novel, an activity book related to the novel and a book about the history of chocolate.\n \n\nThis project is designed to inspire students to become readers and lifelong learners by showing them that books can be fun and interesting. My students are tired of reading from text books that do not interest them, they need to use their imagination and be taken to another place through a good book.  "

They crave an audience that hears them, that sees them, that cheers for them, that knows they are special. And they really are quite special. Their beautifully honest stories tell of happiness, sorrow, jealousy, pride, embarrassment, humor. Scoring the winning goal at their weekend soccer game. Falling off the monkey bars and cutting their lip. Making a new best friend. Saying goodbye to dad leaving on a long vacation. Visiting grandma. Taking the training wheels off their bike for the first time. These small moments mean the world to my students and they can't wait to tell their story! \n\nWith your support, we will produce a ""Kindergarten Film Festival"" at our local movie theater.

It is our job as science teachers to educate our students about the scientific facts and factors that affect and shape our environment. Please help my students learn about acid rain through an engaging, fun, and memorable laboratory activity. \n\nMy students are a unique and diverse group of eighth graders in an environmental studies magnet school. They are passionate, motivated and have a lot of potential, and like other kids their age would love the opportunity to learn science through hands-on projects and collaboration with peers. My students are taught to be aware of local and global environmental issues through various environmental studies elective classes and partnerships with environmental community based organizations. They are committed to making a change and deserve to be rewarded with the resources that will allow them to engage in a fun and informative laboratory activity. \n\nHave you ever seen stained buildings, crumbling statues, or trees that have lost their leaves because of acid rain? Acid rain is a harmful form of pollution. Its effects are also easy to see. \nBeing in an environmental studies magnet, I want my students to be able to learn about the chemical reactions that occur as a result of everyday human actions. Using the requested microplates and chemicals, students will be able to mix chemicals that will react and generate a product that mimics acid rain. Students will make observations and collect data from their experiment, and analyze the results.  \n \nThe materials that I am requesting qualify for the Disney Planet Challenge because they will allow my students to learn about such an important environmentally related scientific concept through a memorable hands-on laboratory activity. While acid rain is a big environmental problem, the gases that cause it are invisible, and so it would be extremely helpful if students could use a visual aid. \n\nConceptual understanding in science is often difficult for young students because they lack a physical representation. Having the materials for this project will allow students in the environmental studies magnet to generate a gas that represents acid rain, observe the reaction of this gas with water, and see how the gas spreads. This will model for my students the harmful effects of a reaction between acid rain and matter in our environment such as ponds, lakes, metals, trees, etc. "

My school is located on an Army airfield, so the majority of my students have parents in active duty. Most of my students have moved schools at least 5 or 6 times and they are only in the 6th grade. My students are constantly concerned about where their families will move next and how long they will get to stay in Hawaii. My students are incredibly resilient. New students enter my class confident and adaptable. These kids have had to become tough. Almost all of my students' parents have served multiple tours in Iraq or Afghanistan. I teach in a SPED inclusion setting, meaning kids with special needs are integrated into our general education class. Roughly half of my students have some sort of learning disability. Amazingly, my students have been able to navigate their disabilities and find a way to shine in the classroom! Each student has something unique to bring to our class. \n\nAt our school, 6th graders are not provided with planners. The students are currently using composition notebooks to haphazardly jot down their homework assignments. This method of organization is just not working for my kids. For many students, this is the first year they are attending a school that is departmentalized, meaning they rotate classes. With this rotational schedule comes a load of responsibility for oneself. My students have struggled with keeping themselves organized enough to be successful in school. The students' low grades are almost a direct reflection of their ability to complete and turn in their homework. Without the practice of homework, students are struggling to keep up. Not to mention, missing assignments result in 0s being averaged into a student's grade. Thus, lowering a student's grade with every missing or late assignment. Secondly, my students need pencils. The first 5 minutes of class always begins with 5 minutes of searching high and low for pencils! \n\nI didn't realize this until I became a teacher, but organization is a skill that has to be taught. It is not an innate ability that students are born with. A great time to start practicing is middle school! I want my students to be as successful as can be in middle school. What they are able to do now will predict their success in high school. High school grades will determine their ability to further their education. The way I see it is, college preparation starts now. Today! "

They thrive with this style of instruction, but it sure can get noisy... \n\nBecause I do not have working headphones in my classroom, my students currently have a hard time hearing their devices. I'm sure you can imagine how the volume tends to get a little out of hand when 30 kids are working independently on several different applications!\n\nIn order for them to make the most out of our classroom technology, it would greatly benefit the students to have headphones for personal use during independent work. This way, they will be able to hear the instructions, stories, narrations, and music that accompany the interactive lessons they complete. Furthermore, the students working in small interventions groups with me will have an easier time listening to the group as we work to advance their skills. \n\nMeeting the needs of 30 learners can be a challenge, but iPads have been a valuable tool to help increase student achievement. In order to make our iPads even more effective, and to keep the classroom running smoothly during small group and independent work, obtaining a classroom set of headphones is essential. Thank you for your help! "

We love to ask questions, and we are always researching the answers so that we can act upon our new knowledge in the community and our school. We attend a school in an urban, inner-city area of a large metroplex in Texas. We are a very diverse school with over 25 countries represented, which means most of us don't speak English at home. We are Title 1, so many of us do not have the resources we need at home to help us. We love learning, so we are always asking questions.  \n\nThe materials we chose are books about resources. We are inquiry based learners, and we have lots of questions about Earth's natural resources and how they effect our planet and our daily lives. We wanted to get books so that we can practice researching and reading, two skills that are very important to our growth as second language learners. With these books we will be able to go through the research process with topics that we care about. We will be able to learn how to utilize texts for research, and learn ways that we can help our community both locally and globally.  \n\nBringing student chosen texts into the classroom makes a huge difference in learning. The students have taken ownership over what they want to learn and how they want to go about learning. This ownership exponentially increases the engagement and depth of the learning process. Having these student chosen texts in our classroom would show the learners that their questions, and learning process are valued.  "

In implementing Project Based Learning in Science, students will use the model magic to create insect models to demonstrate their knowledge of the insect body parts.  In addition, students will use markers or the colored pencils to demonstrate their knowledge of insect and plant life cycles.  These examples of art projects embedded in core content will allow students to problem solve and use critical thinking. \n\nWe need to include art into our curriculum.

Picture books (18 titles) create the backdrop for instruction, including 5 copies of ""The Three Little Pigs.","The picture books that I choose for my writing lessons center around character traits. These lessons target kindergarten to third grade students across our district. \n\nAs a literacy coach, I work in five different schools in our district.  I cover grades from kindergarten to sixth.  Many of the teachers in the lower grades ask for ideas for teaching the character traits. I have begun to pick books that teach a lesson and then have the students write about what they learned.  I am embedding the Language Arts standards along with writing into the lessons.  Sometimes the lesson will lend itself to some art work or play drama. The kindergarten students just finished writing about Rainbow Fish and are trying very hard to share with their classmates.  The teachers do lots of positive feedback during the week after I have taught the lesson. \n\nAs I have a wide range of grades, I do not always have the right book for the right situation.  I have tried to pick books that will go along with our reading/writing standards, but will also allow the students to practice good behaviors in the classroom.  I desperately need a wider range of books to continue this across the grades. \n\nIf we can saturate our young students with models of good behavior and continue to give them lots of positive feedback, hopefully that will carry that forward as they move through the grades.  Bullying, unfortunately, is front and center even in kindergarten. "

Next year I will be with only sophomores.  They are all college bound students that are possibly the first in their family to go to college or graduate with a college degree.  They are individually determined to get good grades and have a good understanding of what they are learning in all of their classes.  The school we are at is 9-12 grade.  We are in a community that is supportive of our school district.  Our campus is full of students that take pride in their school and show their spirit regularly on game days, during homecoming, or during spirit weeks. \n\nThe students present their questions and problem solving steps on white boards in class every Tuesday and Thursday.  I only have 2 mounted white boards in my class, but 4 groups of students working together.  I am hoping to get at least one more white board to mount, if not two in the near future.  \n\nGetting this project funded will allow the students to present their question and problem solving so that their whole group can see.  Currently they have small boards, with hardly any room to work, and they have to hold them while writing.  Time and energy will be saved by having a larger board that can be mounted on the wall. "

What we plan is to have a room where children can come to interact; to play dress up, to play checkers, to do puzzles,  to play with play-doh, to play blocks, and to play ping pong or foosball games.  Time to play but also time to grow emotionally and socially.

They are hungry to learn and practice dance on a daily basis. Our school is very diverse, racially and culturally. Dance appeals to girls naturally whereas for the boys, dance isn't as appealing due to stereotypes such as ""dance is a girls' thing."" The attraction of boys in to the dance program is by explaining to them how dance can improve their athletic performance. Also, boys are involved in a style of dance where it's more masculine and it's ""the cool thing"" to do because they see it on television, movies, and social media. Overall dance gives students an outlet to express their emotions, build their self-confidence. creativity, exhibit discipline and give them a sense of symbolism.    \n\nI've started a social media hashtag called #createdaily where students create dances or take pictures of certain dance moves. I am hoping to land a couple of tablets for them to take photos and to wirelessly print out photos to post on to a bulletin board out in the hallway. Also when students are given a choreography project they will be able to record themselves and give each other critiques on their dances. Videos can also be posted on social media to share with the student body. We would also use the tablets to create slide shows to post and update our website. They are currently creating everyday but it is difficult to keep record of it due to lack of technical devices.  A tablet is mobile, small, and easy enough to configure to accomplish such an artistic movement.  \n\nA couple of tablets would make class more fun and exciting. This way they would be able to show the school (students, teachers, and administration) what they create on a daily basis.

Since I don't have dictionaries in the room when my students come across word that they don't know in Spanish their solution is to turn to on-line translators that are not reliable when misspellings and grammar errors are typed in.

In my class, our main focus is on the students using the language they are learning in real situations. \n\nMy students will use these dictionaries to help them to write stories, essays and scripts for short stories. Their understanding of Spanish literary works and literature will be broadened when they are able to look up the words and phrases they don't understand. More than anything, I will be able to make Spanish more relevant to them. The number of vocabulary words that they can be held responsible is very limited and my students are interested in learning how to talk about themselves and the things that they like and are involved in. These dictionaries will allow them to express themselves, their ideas and feelings beyond just what is on their vocabulary lists. \n\nHaving these dictionaries will allow my students to find their passion in a second language and foster and understanding of a new culture. 10 years from now I want my students to say that they learned something in Spanish and that they were able to use what they learned in my class when they talked to Spanish speakers in their everyday lives.

When we are learning, they want to know more - where it is - when was it used for the first time -etc. It would be great for them to be able to look information up on their own! \n\nMy students will benefit from a laptop in so many ways! They will be so thrilled and excited to use it! Their lives will be changed by becoming better students. Reading, math and writing skills will improve with the use of this technology. "

The spectrum varies in my classroom, as I have learners who are verbal as well as students who are just beginning to use pictures to communicate. Some of my students are reading and writing, while others are working on pre-academic skills, such as matching and imitating. No matter where they fall on the spectrum, each of my students is beautiful, intriguing, and downright amazing in their own ways. \n\nThe goal of this project is to increase my students' basic skills, expand their independent play repertoire, and expose them to a variety of sensory experiences. Students will use materials to practice sorting, matching, 1:1 correspondence, and receptive and expressive identification. Some of the play activities this project will provide my students with include exploring musical instruments, listening to music, and creating with manipulatives. They will be able to take an eyes-, ears-, and hands-on approach to learning about different senses while at the same time meeting their diverse sensory needs with items such as rain sticks, liquid discovery tubes, and sensory beads, balls, and noodles. \n\nMy students' needs oftentimes require a great deal of adult support and supervision. By increasing their basic skills, helping them be able to play independently, and teaching them about their senses, my students will be able to take steps toward reaching independence. "

Right now I don't have any, and when we do labs in class to find the average speed of a moving object, I have them use their cell phone timers.  Not all of the students have cell phones, which allows for them to feel inadequate.  Having stopwatches can allow the students to stay focused on participating in labs and other hands-on activities and not look at their social status. \n\nPlease lend a hand in funding this project to help my students understand concepts like average speed, an everyday concept that they will experience when they drive and travel.

They appreciate structured and up to date teaching tools as a way for them to connect math concepts to real life situation. Unfortunately, many of them are from homes and lives that often are focused on the most immediate of human needs. Many of them receive free or reduced lunch and come from homes that do not own much of these technology. The school that these students attend consist of 80% of students  who are economically disadvantaged and with diverse student population. \n\nWith the netbook students will be able to have access to global and interactive resources. For example, students will be able to see the coordinate plane and graphs through the different websites available in the virtual world. Students will be able to graph linear functions and quadratic functions through the different sites offer and will have deeper understanding and connection of the lesson because of the interaction capability that I can create with the netbook and other tools.  Additionally, with 37 students, the ones in the back of the room can't see a lot of what is projected. Many students today do not like math because they struggle with the concepts because they cannot make any connection to the subject nor do they see or understand the importance of math. With the netbook I can make math lessons more interesting and engaging for the students.  \n\nMy project is important because all students deserve to learn math in different ways. Many students learn differently and with today's students they are fascinated and more engaged with lessons that are taught through the use of technology. Affluent schools should not be the only schools that can afford to provide these resources for their students. Please consider this project as part of Chevron classroom challenge.  "

We need a large classroom library with a variety of book choices so that each student in my class, no matter his/her reading level or genre preferences, can find the book they've been searching for. \n\nMy students call Texas home and attend a Title 1 school. 100% are Hispanic and 23/24 qualify for the free lunch program. Many are first generation Americans and speak Spanish at home. Ours is a dual-language classroom, which means Spanish is incorporated, but most of the instruction is in English. Before they graduate to middle school, it is extremely important that they develop English speaking, reading, writing, and listening skills that allow them to perform on a high academic level. \n\nAs my school is limited in the amount of resources it has, our library often does not meet the needs and satisfy the desires of my students. Each Thursday we make our weekly trip to the library, and my 24 young minds line up in anticipation, eager to explore the shelves to find their next favorite book. However, they often find that they've read most of the books on their reading level, or they can't find anything they're truly interested in. Because of this, I'd like to build a classroom library that never makes them feel like there isn't a book out there that was written for them. \n\nAs I prepare my students to begin their Middle and High school education, it is my desire to give them as many advantages as possible. They are up against a lot, as they've spent most or all their lives in a low-income area, attending low-income schools. If they can graduate from 5th grade having developed a love for reading, they have a far better chance of making it to and through college. "
Teaching Music With Technology,"Sometimes, I just don't understand. Everyone else seems to know what the teacher is talking about, my friend tried to explain it to me, but I still don't understand.

Everyone else seems to know what the teacher is talking about, my friend tried to explain it to me, but I still don't understand.  There has to be an app for that, right? \n\nMy school is highly diverse with an excellent mix of students from all around the globe.  We serve students who are English language learners, students with a variety of special needs, and an exciting representation of cultures.  Currently, our school provides quality instruction for students in grades four through six, and it is expected that we will be adding third grade to our school next year.  The children in our school love to make music in many ways.  We offer band, orchestra, choir and general music.  All students take general music and learn to play recorder, West African and Latin drumming, and experience Orff-based music instruction.  They are the center of the program and are the driving creative force in the music classroom. \n\nDifferentiation is an important part of learning for students.  My students come from a variety of musical backgrounds and experiences, and are at many different levels of musical understanding that varies from topic to topic and skill to skill.  The iPads will allow me to create and implement differentiated lessons for students who may need extra help to understand a topic or concept, or to create a more advanced individualized lesson for a student or small group of students who need a challenge.  Having iPads that are dedicated to the music room will enable me to purchase apps that are appropriate for music and install them on just the music iPads.  They will also be available for students to use on a daily basis whenever they need reinforcement or challenge, instead of only when I am able to sign them out from shared iPad cart.   While the vast majority of our music instruction is ""hands on"" music making, incorporating technology into all subject areas is vital to student success. \n\nHaving iPads in the music classroom will enhance the learning experience for my students because I will be able to easily meet them where they are musically and give them the extra reinforcement and practice to meet their goals.  It will also allow my advanced students to stretch and grow with individualized projects and instruction.  Adding technology to our music classroom will allow all of my students to be more successful in all subject areas and in their daily lives. "
CD/DVD Player,I am requesting a portable CD-DVD player and literacy DVDs for students to use to reinforce reading concepts.,My students need a portable classroom CD-DVD player and literacy DVDs.,"Help me reach my auditory and visual learners with a CD-DVD learning center. Everyone learns differently; however, the majority of students acquire information aurally and visually. So during centers, I would like to target aural and visual learners using a CD-DVD player to reinforce literacy skills. \n\nI teach Kindergarten at a Title 1 school, which means that most students qualify for free or reduced lunch. Kindergarten is the beginning of a child's educational journey. This is a foundational year for reading; therefore, it is critical to build a strong foundation in literacy to set students up to be great, proficient readers. Oftentimes, creative teaching experiences get passed over due to the sheer cost of their implementation. Incorporating technology into the classroom is one such obstacle because of the cost involved. Technology is a powerful tool in the classroom because it can help to motivate and to engage students in ways that other educational materials cannot. Therefore, I am requesting a portable CD-DVD player and literacy DVDs for students to use to reinforce reading concepts. \n\nIn Kindergarten, students acquire fundamental reading skills.  With understanding and practice, students are able to apply these skills to read!  A portable CD-DVD player would enable my students to practice literacy skills learned in class during learning center time.  Students would be able to use the CD-DVD player for a variety of activities—to listen to stories on CD/DVDs, to watch recorded classroom lessons, and to sing and dance with our phonics and literacy DVDs.  These activities would reinforce the phonics and literacy skills that are key in developing good readers. \n\nYou can help my students use technology to become better readers! Your donation will ensure that my students are maximizing their potential in a fun and interactive way. Anything donated would be greatly appreciated, welcomed, and put to use by a class-full of eager learners! Without your support, this project is not possible. Will you please help our classroom? "

We need more ink for our classroom printer so we can copy and print their writing and drawings. Then I can use student stories as new texts for reading and classroom discussions. Students respond with enthusiasm to their own stories, and in a dual-immersion classroom those stories help all students build new vocabulary in both languages. \n\nIn addition, with English language games (vocabulary match ups and blends/digraphs cards) and desk strips to model cursive writing, many students will get just the help they need to master the aspects of writing that interfere with their ability to write accurately and easily.  Finally, the class needs an organized way to sort first drafts from finished writing and turn in their completed writing projects to be published using the new ink and our classroom printer. \n\nUsing student work as a central part of our reading gives my students a public audience for their written work and is an effective way to increase the details and clarity of student writing.

They have their materials in, on, and around their desks. \n\nI currently work as a fourth grade bilingual teacher in an impoverished area of Southern California. The population I work with includes a majority of English Language Learners. I feel that one of my primary responsibilities is to improve their reading and writing skills in English and Spanish. Can you imagine all the materials that they need to have for their daily work as well as in both languages? There isn't much room anywhere in the classroom for me to store their materials. We need a place that is easy to access and is not in the way. The storage center is perfect and fits both the criteria. \n\nThis storage center will help eliminate all the clutter they currently have in their work space. It will save instructional time that is usually wasted on looking for where their books, journals, white board, or notebooks are. I try to teach my students how to keep their items organized but there is very little organization possible when you have 2 state mandated language arts textbooks (English and Spanish), mathematics textbook, science textbook, health textbook, social studies consumable book, 6 consumable language arts text books (3 in English and 3 in Spanish), ELD notebook, writing folder, writer's notebook, journal, reading baggie (with 4 books for the week) and white board. Oh! and I forgot their pencil boxes. \n\nPlease help my students de-clutter their desks and get organized.

Many boys are reluctant to read, and coercing them is often a painful process.  Ben Mikaelson, author of ""Touching Spirit Bear,"" has solved that problem by writing a book that will draw in many young fans! \n\nMy students are interested in fast-paced action and adventure, and historical literature just doesn't quite cut it.  As military students, these kids are familiar with moving, deployments, war, and much more.  Their lives are often emotional, filled with turmoil and uncertainty.  Many of them are looking for a means of escape and understanding, and they hunger for that one book that will engage and fascinate them. \n\nThe title I am requesting, ""Touching Spirit Bear,"" allows me to meet the needs of my students in many ways.  The author, Ben Mikaelson, has provided an exciting, action-filled plot that will engage even the most reluctant reader.  Since the novel is steeped in Native American tradition, symbolism is a major component of the novel, and it perfectly complements the age level of my students.  My military students especially will find it compelling, because the main character experiences many of the same emotions that they deal with daily.  Emotions like rage, sorrow, neglect, anger, abuse, and stress begin the novel, but gradually shift as the main character grows and matures.  Students will finish this book and then clamor eagerly to read the sequel, thus fueling an even greater reading frenzy. \n\nWith your help, I can show students the important elements of excellent modern literature, while helping them learn about important literary concepts and ideas. I can fuel reading by introducing students to an engaging author who creates dramatic page-turners that keep even the most reluctant reader enthralled.  Finally, this book and the accompanying discussions and activities all directly correlate with my state standards. "

I believe that by reading stories about these situations, my students will become more excited about making connections to books which in turn will make them want to read more! \n\nYou will make it possible for my students to realize that fiction books can relate to their own real-life stories and situations.

They are hardworking students who come to school everyday with desire to learn something new. They want to become readers and fine tune their daily living skills in the process. They are outgoing and fun as well as determined. They persevere  through any task that is given to them even though they struggle on a daily basis. \n\nIf my classroom was provided with an Ipad it would open up a door for these students. Not only are they students with intellectual disabilities, but they are also from families that cannot provide the type of technology that we might be able to provide them with at school. Having an Ipad in the classroom would allow me to create and utilize individual applications to further their reading, make movies and videos, and hone in on the basic reading skills that they have not been able to learn. Being able to use this type of technology with the students will open their eyes to the new technology out in the world as well as have a tremendous impact on their reading/functional skills. \n\nPlease consider donating and supporting this project. I am a 2nd year teacher who is trying to help these students who are in middle school learn how to read. I also want to make sure they are exposed to the new technology and learn safe ways to use it.

Our most popular lessons are ones that incorporate songs or body movement They live in a high-poverty, urban community and attend a public, neighborhood school. The school is under-resourced and in great need of supplies.  \n\nWhen my project is funded, my students will benefit greatly from having a magazine rack and magazine bins in the classroom. The magazine rack will be a part of our classroom library. It will organize the many, magazines that we have gotten this year from Scholastic, my personal collection, and donations. Organizing the magazines will make them more accessible to students. My kids will be able to see when new editions are in and it will encourage students to practice their organization skills and keep the library neat. \n\nMy students need magazine bins to organize their textbooks! Class sets of books are organized by table. When the books are neatly stored in magazine bins students can easily get their books at the start and end of class, they feel ownership towards their personal supplies and I can tell who the messy ones are! \n\nMy project is important because my students deserve the very best. I want them to be in an orderly, neat and bright environment during the school day because many of my students have very different environments at home.  "

Did it change your engagement and love of books and literacy? \n\nSome of my second grade students are beginning to average readers.  They are reluctant readers and don't find joy in reading.  They are unable to utilize technology in the classroom because of our recent budget cuts.  I would like to help support their literacy needs by providing books to listen to on iPods.  This will also allow me the opportunity to support a home-school connection with my low income families and allow my students to take home the iPods and books to read at home. \n\nUsing more technology in the classroom will encourage my students to read more and be more engaged with books.  As we move into the 21st century, our district lacks to finances to provide students with technology support.  Soon students will use computers and devices such as the iPads to read and never pick up a book.  I would like the chance to provide my reluctant and non-readers with some technology support in the classroom to get them more engaged with books and start using 21st century skills. \n\nProviding us this opportunity will help my reluctant and non-readers to be more engaged with books and help support their literacy needs through listening to reading both in school and at home.

A brand new school year is just around the corner, and with that comes the exciting opportunity to get my new class of fourth grade students in Harlem, New York off to a great start! I have huge goals for my students and one of the most important ones is to make great strides in reading. I am determined to help each of my students grow at least 1.5 years in reading levels this year and to turn them into lifelong readers. Fourth grade is a big year in the lives of New York school children because their test scores count for so much – not only for themselves, but for their schools as well. We have so much to accomplish by January that we need to light our fires for reading right away! \n\nWhile excellent teaching and inspiration will motivate my students to work hard, the only way any of us ever improves is through practice. My students need to log in hours and hours of independent reading in order to truly augment their vocabulary and to improve their decoding and comprehension skills. It is my goal to make readers out of my students – not just test takers – so this is my opportunity to make reading an important and enjoyable part of their lives. \n\nTo get my students off to the right start, I am asking for a class set of Reader's Book Logs from Lakeshore Learning. These book logs will help my students engage with each of the books that they read independently on multiple levels, and encourage them to keep on reading as they track their accomplishments on the Book Record. Organized, fun, friendly, and academically challenging, I can't think of a better vehicle for reading growth than these neat little logs. To make my students accountable for their own learning and reading so early in the year would be an incredible feat. To make them excited about reading and motivated to work hard on their comprehension skills in addition would be even better! Help my students jump into an exciting world of books and learning!\n"

They also need bean bag chairs. ","Books give students information about the world they come in contact with every day but may not understand.  Younger children are curious about the world around them and want to know how things happen, how the work, and what happened in the past to cause things to be the way they are now.    \n\nI teach a group of special needs children ages 5-11.  I work with all disability levels from Moderate Mental Impairment to ADHD.  They all come from impoverished families and live in an impoverished area.  Most of them don't have access to books at home.  Many of them don't have a stable home life.  I want my students to think of my classroom and our school as a comforting place they can go and be safe.  My students enjoy learning about science, social studies and  history.  They are very curious about why things work they way they do.   \n\nI would like to create a beautiful classroom library for my students. I have requested many science, history, and social studies books for my students to read.  When they pick out their own books, they seem to gravitate toward nonfiction titles.  I would also like to give them a comfortable place to sit while they read.  That is why I requested bean bag chairs.  I can just see them laying on the bean bag chairs, immersed in a story about Abraham Lincoln or butterflies.  Even the students who can't read as well love to look through the books at the colorful pictures and make their own stories about what is going on in the book.  Having this library would greatly help the students to improve their vocabularies, increase experience with text, and pump up their critical thinking skills.  This would also help them to learn responsibility because it would be their job to take care of and maintain the library. \n\nI believe having a beautiful, cozy, inviting classroom library would really inspire them to read.  Also, having a good set of books that is theirs would give a sense of ownership to children who have so little.  I believe they would be thrilled beyond words if they could have a cozy library, all their own.  This would mean the earth to a group of students who are often ignored by the rest of the world.   "

Our biggest challenge with that is we don't have the textbooks and supplemental materials to support the new Common Core.  So, we find what we can to get by. \n\nMy students are an inclusion class, meaning I team-teach with a special education teacher, and we have a mixed class of general ed students and special ed students.  They are eager to learn science and social studies because being able to see and touch engages their minds, and motivates them to learn.\nOur school is a Title 1, low-income school, with bilingual and ELL students.  It is the oldest school in our district, and the main building have been around since the 70's, and used to belong to another district. A large percentage of our school is on the free and reduced lunch program, as well as many of our students are serviced by our backpack program, where food is sent home over the weekends and breaks. \n\nThe History of US will serve as a teacher textbook for teaching social studies.  As we do not have a provided set of texts, I would use the books to guide my teaching, as well as present under the document camera for the whole class to see and follow along, as well as view the pictures.  This would be an invaluable resource, as it is a very in-depth series, and perfectly covers our assigned era in American History, as we are to cover American Exploration through the Civil War.\nThe Liberty's Kids DVD set is the perfect supplemental material to the American Revolution.  My students are very visual learners, and showing them the wars is very powerful.  This series follows all the major events and battles of the American Revolution, and presents it at their level so they understand.  These videos would be used after a lesson as a closure, to reinforce the mental picture we have built on major American Revolution events. \n\nYour donations, and receiving these materials, will drastically improve my students understanding of the American Revolution, and understanding how our country was formed and its principles.  These students are our future, and they need to know what has been done before them, so they don't repeat mistakes. They are the generation that is going to be making decisions for us, and I want them to be well informed, so they make good decisions. "

Despite these obstacles, donors like you have made my classroom a child's scientific playground where students discover, analyze, and observe.\n\nA few years ago, a donor gave us these really interesting science specimens that are encased in acrylic. These bug blocks have been admired by many students and visiting adults (especially our janitor who gets a kick out of the spider). The specimens are favored because you can see so many wonderful details. I even find them fascinating and I'm terrified of bugs. These items have exposed my students (and my colleagues' kids) to different animals and assisted them in learning various animal characteristics. This is an important development for our classroom because so many of our students are sheltered in our Los Angeles urban area. They rarely experience life outside our concrete environment.\n\nIn order to improve our collection and add new excitement, I am seeking a centipede specimen, a walking stick specimen, and two sets of bug specimens (there are 4 blocks in each set). These new acrylic blocks will help my 4th grade students maintain their science curiosity and provide additional resources to record in our science notebooks. I will also be able share these items with my peers, as I often do with our current specimens.\n\nI hope that you are able to help us obtain different science specimens that keep our classroom a place where students can discover and examine unfamiliar bugs.

Our school is in the absolute poorest Congressional District in the entire United States.  The children in our school have been rigorously instructed in music, and they routinely perform the music of the great masters in a moving and passionate manner.  They also play a good deal of popular and holiday music.  Many of our children have auditioned at Juilliard, both this year and last year, but only one was accepted because their sight-reading skills are not up to par for Juilliard.  There simply aren't enough hours in the day for a cluster teacher (servicing 120 students daily) to give the kind of individualized instruction required for teaching sight-reading.  Another skill in which our children are sorely lacking is composing music. The inclination to compose is natural, and is required by the NYS Music standards.  These children are bursting with ideas about music, and need to hash out their ideas and express them.  \n\nComposing used to mean sitting at a piano with pencil and manuscript paper, painstakingly drawing all the symbols,   working for hours only to find that once you try to perform the piece, it isn't what was expected.  Trying to observe ALL the conventions of writing music really blocks the creative flow, especially in young people. Computer music has changed this forever.  Computers allow children who wouldn't otherwise have the chance to try many different melodies, chord progressions, voicings and arrangements, etc.  They'd be able to hear how the melodies work together to create harmony and counterpoint, and evaluate different solutions to musical problems. With a computer and software, they could hook up the electronic keyboards to the computer, and could experiment and refine their composing and sight-reading skills. Sight-reading is a critical skill for students wishing to go on to intermediate or advanced study, but often acts as a stumbling block, because the system of decoding (and encoding) music on paper is so very daunting for children.  Since music has not been a real priority in schools in this area, there is no hardware or software for students to use in this manner.  Their track record clearly indicates that they deserve the resources needed to dramatically increase their sight-reading skills and finally be able to realize their dreams of composing.  Please help us.  \n"

The cushions, ball, backpatter's seat, beads, and mat will help the kids remain calm and focused so that we can have the opportunity to read anti-bullying books, watch videos, and have class discussions. My students may be very young, but many know that bullying exists and have experienced it themselves. We are committed to put an end to bullying in our school. The resources requested will be a huge factor in helping us accomplish our goal. This in turn, will help ensure that school is a place where they can come and feel safe, confident, and ready to learn. \n\nWe have a responsibility as teachers, to create a safe learning environment.

When students are knowledgeable and confident their learning and interest is exponential. Reading is one of the most important skills we acquire. iPads will help foster individuality and personalization to acquire the skills needed to become a proficient reader. Differentiated instruction challenges students at their own learning levels. iPads will facilitate reading through different available online activities which support literacy learning.

Although we are an ""A"" school, we continue to strive to be better. Our school is overcrowded and do not get to visit the library on a regular basis. The students really get involved in Sunshine State Readers, but don't make it to the library to check them out. The parents can't afford to buy these 15 books for them and the students become discouraged when they can't get their hands on the next book. As a classroom teacher who loves to read, I want to offer this portable library to them. \n\nReading opens a new world for students. It is important that students read often. We require 20 minutes of reading each evening, and students need books in which they can check out to complete their homework. Many students do not possess books in their home. This is also a great opportunity for the parents to get involved with reading with their child. \n\nKids are our future! I feel honored that I am able to be vital part of a child's education. Students need books available to them in order to become better readers. Our classrooms are soooo small that a portable reading center will be easy for students to access on a daily basis in their own classroom. "

The flash drives will also allow the students to store all their work in one place making their library of work easily accessible.,"Help I can't find my work and I was almost done.""  This is often the cry of my 24 fifth graders who share a cart of computers with 5 other classes.  Work gets erased, changed, or 'borrowed',  and the students must start over.  The result is discouragement and much time and effort wasted. \n\nMy students are inner city kids and the majority  of them are second language learners.  They attend a Title 1 school where free breakfasts and lunches are available for all. As a school, we proudly fly a California Distinguished School Service Award Flag for continual improvement in our standardized tests and our service to others and our community. The students serve as play leaders for younger children, work in the school cafeteria, as well as plant, maintain, and harvest our school garden.  The majority do not own a computer, and of those that do, only a handful have access to the Internet. Our school has a computer lab where all the students in the school visit once a week for 45 minutes. The second floor of our building has a cart of 24 computers that are shared between 5 on track upper grade classes, with each class getting them for one day of the week, during which time the students do research, write reports, and create stories. \n\nWith the students ability to save and retrieve their work easily using their own individual 4GB flash drive, less time will be wasted redoing assignments or searching all the computers looking for saved work. The flash drives will allow the students to store all their work in one place making their library of work easily accessible. The use of flash drives will bring a new technical skill to the students' ever growing understanding of how to efficiently and effectively use a computer. \n\nThe opportunity for all students to have their own flash drive will definitely give faster access to saved work on the computer.  Faster access will result in less time lost.  Less time lost will result in more opportunity for each student to spend more time on improving and expanding their research and writing skills.  "
Learning by Doing,"Learning is always more fun when you have cool tools to help you do so.

When a mind as young as that of a Kindergrtner is exposed to learning, what better than with materials that they'll enjoy using? \n\nMy class consists of Kindergrtners ages 5 and 6. They enjoy singing, listening to stories, learning new spellings and drawing pictures amongst many other things. We belong to a school with a population of about 500 students. We are fairly new to our community, but are well-liked by the parents and community members. \n\nEvery year our school has suffered monetary cutbacks that have affected the resources available to our students directly. We have less materials available to us and whatever breaks down cannot be replaced because of lack of funds. The Writing Practice Magic Boards I requested can greatly assist my students in their daily practice of simple words and spellings that they are taught frequently. These boards can really assist us in our penmanship practice, CVC words practice, name practice and even sentence formation! \n\nBy choosing to donate to our project, you are helping make writing practice more involved and helping us expand our venues of learning. The boards will provide an easy, effective and fun way of reviewing sounds, spellings and learn letter-formation. The possibilities are endless! "
Mathematics Books for My Classroom Library,"These books will appeal to a range of students, regardless of their reading abilities.","My students need 15 books about math such as ""Secrets, Lies, and Algebra"" to make connections between the subject and the real world.  Having books about math will help me make my case that it is essential for survival.","I teach 8th Grade (Mathematics, Social Studies and Language Arts) in a small urban school.  Each grade level has one teacher and the school serves grades Pre-k to Eighth.  I have 31 students and most of them are Hispanic or African American and low-income. \n\nMy students surveyed their classroom library to find books about the content they are learning.  They noticed the library lacked books on Mathematics.  Not having books about Mathematics is like saying, ""Math's not applicable or important in life."" \n\nI meet with a cohort of middle school Mathematics teachers once a week and I asked the members to recommend literature for teaching math concepts.  They listed picture books, cook books, chapter books and more.  These books will appeal to a range of students, regardless of their reading abilities. \n\nI've learned that my 8th grade students still love hear picture books read to them.  I use picture books in my classroom on a regular basis for teaching higher order thinking and skills, but I do not have any books in my classroom for teaching mathematics.  Your generosity will help me teach my students mathematical concepts they will need to be successful in high school."

Many of my students are reading below grade-level, largely because of their lack of familiarity with the English language.  However, my students are eager to learn, and feel accomplished when they obtain a new bit of interesting information to share with friends or family members.  \n\nMy students need reading materials that interest them, that they can read and comprehend, and that provide them with information that they can take ownership of and share.  I am therefore asking for a grant to purchase a subscription for Time for Kids magazines for my classroom.  \n\nTime for Kids provides up-to-date, kid friendly, news and information.  The magazine comes with activity sheets to help students process and connect with what they are reading.  In addition, the Time for Kids website provides Spanish translations of the same comprehension sheets found in the magazines.\n\nI believe my students will benefit from having Time for Kids in the classroom by being more informed of world news, and therefore more connected to the world outside their neighborhood.  The magazines will provide my students with more choices for on-level reading material to digest in the classroom, and valuable comprehension-building activities to embark on during classroom free time or at home. I will also be able to use the magazines as a valuable teaching tool and reference as we are addressing Social Studies and Science standards in the classroom.\n"

For many, it is the first formal schooling experience.  For all, it is a place to learn and grow. Daisy-shaped tables will facilitate interaction and collaboration among my little worker bees and help them on their way. \n\nMy kindergartners represent a true cross-section of our city. They come from a variety of neighborhoods and backgrounds, and represent all socio-economic brackets.  Some have been to preschool, but for many this is their first exposure to the alphabet, reading and writing.  Given the diversity in background and exposure, it is crucial that all the children are engaged in the activity and have equal interaction with me, their teacher, as well as the opportunity to collaborate.\n\nCurrently my students are working on long tables that are wobbly with stained and scarred writing surfaces.  The format makes it difficult for me to interact with all students equally and give them the assistance they need while the condition of the tables makes it difficult for the students to work. \n\nI would like the furniture in my classroom to facilitate my inclusive teaching philosophy and create an environment that is conducive to learning.  Daisy-shaped tables will eliminate the blind corners of a rectangular table and will allow the children all to engage in the activity and give students equal access to supplies and me, their teacher. A decent writing surface will help the children with one of the most important skills they will learn during Kindergarten:  learning to write. \n\nIt is so important that children’s first school experience is positive, inclusive, and nurturing.  These new daisy tables will keep the students engaged in the activity at hand, setting them up for a successful school career.  Please help give my wonderful little worker bees decent tables! "

They receive free meals due to their low economic status. \n\nBooks are a great tool to help teach lessons and are an easy way to start classroom discussions. The books about bullying will help my students understand the harm bullying brings and how to handle bullies, and will instill the importance of kindness. The art materials I've requested will help my students express themselves through art. Being able to paint, draw, create, and have other necessary everyday classroom materials will allow the children to become creative with their ways of thinking, expressing themselves, and handling bullies. I want my students to have a voice, even if it's through a picture. \n\nYour donation will make a huge impact on my students' learning.

Elmo to the Rescue!,"The Elmo Document Reader will allow a ""real time"" opportunity to hone in on the essential organizational skills necessary to succeed at the high school and college levels.",My students need a document reader to help reinforce essential organizational and learning skills in the classroom.,"Inspiring high-risk students to attend college! I am an inclusion teacher in an alternative education program in an urban school district in Indiana.  The students that I serve come from an impoverished area and 87% of the school receives free and reduced lunch. The district has identified my students as being under-grade and over-age.  They are in grades 5-8.  Several of the students have special learning needs and most are visual and auditory learners. \n\nThe goal of the program is to teach and reinforce the skills needed to ""catch up"" the two or more years the students have been retained.  These skills are taught during the course of one academic year. Unfortunately, due to budget cuts in the district, many of the essential resources are not available or not working.  Despite the lack of resources, however, the students persevere, and are very eager to catch up to their peers.  In addition, all of them have goals of graduating high school and attending college in the future. \n\nIn order to adequately prepare my students for college, they need to acquire organizational skills and need reinforcement of skills learned in the classroom.  The Elmo Document Reader will allow a ""real time"" opportunity to hone in on the essential organizational skills necessary to succeed at the high school and college levels.  For example, students will be able to see me model note-taking skills or organization of a binder by viewing it on the projector. The primary focus in the program is on math and language arts.  Reading skills can be demonstrated and modeled with the Elmo.  Many of my students cannot afford eye-glasses.  The document reader also helps to enlarge the item so that students who do have some visual impairment can also see what is going on.  Furthermore, the document reader reaches all types of learning styles by showing and talking about the skill at the same time.  Students can also follow along if it is a kinesthetic activity that is part of the lesson. \n\nWith your help, my students, who otherwise may not have had this opportunity,  will realize their dreams of going to college can be a reality when they have the right tools and the right attitude!"

My county has the highest poverty level within our tri-county area.  Many of our children are Hispanic or come from families with little to no education.   \n\nI have found that children learn a tremendous amount through electronic learning games.  The games are able to keep their attention much longer than I can by teaching.  Last year I was able to teach a non-speaking English child through electronic games.  He was so intrigued with playing the game, he never realized how much he was actually learning.  His parents even started learning with the games.  Many of my parents either won't or can't help children with homework, however the children can assist in practicing skills without the help of a parent. \n\nWith these resources in my class, students will use the games within centers.

Many of our students have limited English and need real world, hands on experiences to help them make connections to science and develop vocabulary. \n\nMore than half of our students receive free or reduced lunches. Many are from immigrant families. Most are from families where poverty spans generations. They are eager to learn and achieve, but get little experience outside the classroom beyond television and video games. \n\nThis school year, we will involve students with the planning, measuring, designing and planting of a science garden and outdoor classroom. Students will put math principles to real life use and see science in action. The books that I have requested will help us shape the garden and plan lessons where math, science, and language learning will be maximized through student interaction in the garden. \n\nStudents will begin to see the real world value of math and science when they can apply what they have learned in the classroom to solve challenges they face in the garden. This project will go beyond pencil and paper to enhance math and science instruction. It will enhance language acquisition by offering students a whole new world of vocabulary for experiences in the natural world and a chance to share those experiences through conversation and writing.

Our classroom provides a specialized early learning environment that provides fun opportunities for exploration in a sensory rich environment designed to facilitate brain-centered learning for preschoolers with autism. \n\nMy students are between the ages of 3 and 5 years old, and are all moderately to severely impacted by an autism spectrum disorder. They have limited communication skills and a high demand for sensory input. Their sensory seeking needs often result in repetitive behaviors that preoccupy their focus. Providing a sensory rich environment allows the opportunity to create individualized sensory diets that meet each student's individual sensory needs. Consequently, individualized sensory diets create the neurological focus for brain-centered learning. \n\nThe materials requested will be used in our sensory explorer area of the classroom. Students participate in 20-minute learning centers, and are then provided with a 10-minute sensory motor break.  These materials are designed to meet the sensory needs of vestibular feedback. Spinning and rocking provide input to the brain through the vestibular system. Many students on the spectrum have a high demand for vestibular input. The ability to spin, climb or rock will meet the sensory need for vestibular input, thus allowing greater brain-centered learning during the students' next learning center. \n\nYour donation will help to provide the variety of materials needed to provide a varied, rich sensory environment that will support my students in learning how to regulate their needs for sensory input, and learning how to prepare their brain for optimal, brain-centered learning.  As I facilitate their foundation for a lifetime of optimal brain-centered learning, my goal is to teach my students how they learn best. "

Halifax County is a low income area with over 90% of its students receiving free and reduced lunches.  I have been teaching at Inborden Elementary School for the past three(3) years and know that there is a great need for reading materials that can bridge the gap between school and home.  One such item would be Take Home Books from Starfall.  These books will be sent home by the teachers, in a take home bag, in order for the parents to listen to their child read and assist them with their reading skills.  These books serve as an enhancement to the reading program already established in the classroom.  In addition to the Take Home books, Starfall offers phonics and writing exercises that parallel the Take Home Books. This too would be an added enhancement for the students' reading level. Students will also be able to access the Learn to Read computer program that parallels the stories and sounds out the words in the book."
Learning through Music,"Schools that are turning themselves around are engaging students each and every day, and one way they are doing this is through music.

","Music is motivating and can engage students into learning, as well as work to relax during work time.  I will be teaching first grade this year and know what an important year this is for children learning to read and liking school. Our school has become a failing school in the last few years and I want to help turn that around! \n\nResearch shows that students will be more engaged in learning if music is used. By focusing on student learning, I want for all my students to look forward to school everyday, have fun, and learn as much as they can! I want to bring the fun and energy back into the classroom using music to help. \n\nI am requesting an IPOD Touch for our classroom to use for many reasons. First will be that I can download individual songs focusing on a specific skill as well as full Cd's made just for elementary students and even first grade students.  These will be easily accessible and organized in the IPOD Touch to ensure instructional time is not wasted searching for a song. The Cd's I am requesting focus on character education, math, phonics, exercise, group time, and much more.  They all come with lyrics so the students will be able to practice reading while singing.   \nAnother use for this IPOD Touch will be during work time.  Playing appropriate music during work times such as Reader's Workshop has shown to calm students and keep them focused on the task at hand. The reason I have requested an IPOD Touch is because I can subscribe to XM Radio which will allow for me to not have to download numerous songs for the quiet time.  I will be able to use a channel that will continuously play music.  XM would also allow us to listen to children music as a break or if the class would earn it. \nStudents will be able to learn how to use this and eventually it could be a classroom job to work the IPOD. \n\nSchools that are turning themselves around are engaging students each and every day, and one way they are doing this is through music. You will make it possible for me to use music daily and will allow me to download new songs often so the students do not loose interest.

Often, my students come from homes in which they are the primary care provider for their siblings or have children of their own.  Despite the rough situations they are forced to deal with, many come to school motivated and ready to be successful.  Unfortunately, inclusion classes typically have half standard and half inclusion children, most of which read on or below a fifth grade level.   \n\nMy students are intelligent and can understand the literary elements I try to teach them, but it is difficult to correctly identify anything in a book that is on or above a ninth grade reading level.  By being able to provide a novel with visuals, as well as text, my students will better comprehend the literature and will be given the chance to love these classic stories! \n\nThese kids come to us from rough situations looking for help.  They deserve the resources they need to be successful, lifelong readers.  Unfortunately, so many of my students do not believe they are intelligent or that there is a bright future for them.

Having the necessary resources to build on these students' cognitive, motor and communication skills is very important. The iPads will be used to help my students develop and increase their attention span, build on fine motor skills and improve recognition of numbers and alphabets as well as learn how to use technology and understand its purpose. \n\nI will use the iPads to help aid in differentiating my instruction, build on student communication and social skills, as well as increase their attention. They will give my students more hands-on experiences and increase problem-solving strategies. My students will learn new words to express what they see and hear. Every activity on the iPads will provided an opportunity to build language skills. With added sensory experiences, combined with the scaffolding of adults and peers, my students will become more perceptive. Both of the iPads will help increase language, math, and reading and communication skills. \n\nEvery modified activity on the iPads will allow opportunities to build language, math and verbal skills. Children need to use their senses and be engaged in meaningful experiences. When students are exposed to different forms of technology, learning comes alive and their attention span increases. "

","In my class we are all about making connections, new discoveries, and learning to see the world and ourselves from a different perspective. My students are hungry to learn about different cultures and history through historical fiction. This unit is a perfect way to help them learn about survival. \n\nMy students are a wonderful group of kids who have some challenges but who love to read, love to learn, and are always asking questions and seeking knowledge. Some students face financial challenges, family instability, and various educational challenges. Despite these challenges these are students with tremendous promise and need only get the nurturing and educational support they deserve. \n\nThese books will be used to provide the basis of a historical fiction unit which focuses on WWII--in particular the war in Asia. In So Far From The Bamboo Grove, one of two anchor texts, students read the story of Yoko Kawashima Watkins and her family's harrowing escape from Korea in 1945 and their hardships adjusting to life in post-war Japan. The accompanying texts will be offered to students as reading extension to be read in literature circles. All books will form the basis of various projects which will be used to assess student understanding. For example, students will have an opportunity to learn about Japanese culture and a period of time when U.S. and Japanese culture intersect. Students also will learn about the effects of war on civilians and the damage fear and racial discrimination can do to people and societies. \n\nOur English department struggles every year to invest in the necessary materials. We currently do not have enough books for all three of our English teachers to provide books to all of our students. As a result we must juggle books so that all students can get a chance to read the book which is part of our 7th grade curriculum. In addition, the books we have are falling apart and our students deserve better. "

Luckily, we have been graciously given lots of games and supplies to utilize in our learning.  Unfortunately, much of the burden of organizing these classroom supplies has fell upon my shoulders and even my students'.  From the 20 board games we keep in our room, to the plethora of flashcards and dry erase markers, we need a place to put all of these wonderful supplies.   \n\nThe resources I have requested will allow me to find a place for each supply, game, and even student notebook to ease transitions and create more time for learning.  Furthermore, student organization will embolden them to take ownership of many of the things they can organize in their own chair back, one of the items I requested.  Students ability to easily access and return items is imperative in a clean and functional workspace for 2nd graders.   \n\nThese items will make it possible for me to give my students the ownership they crave over organizing and keeping our classroom neat and tidy.  Having their very own chair back will allow them to access all the necessary items for a lesson, and will cut down on the scuffling around the classroom that can be such a distraction during learning time.  I hope you will help us to purchase these items so we can operate the best kind of classroom there is: an organized and efficient one! "

Now imagine many of those students are struggling writers who (gasp!) don't like writing or don't consider themselves writers.  The hardest part is giving them real-time feedback.\n\nI teach all my students that writers always need an audience. Currently, in order to have a class share and discuss a student's work, I have to go search for transparencies to copy a student's writing, pray the copier is free (and working) and then bring it to class the next day to use on the overhead.  Unfortunately, not all students get to see their work projected and it is not as meaningful as it could be. \n\nNow, imagine students writing their hearts out and when it is time for sharing, simply picking up a few writer's notebooks and projecting them on the wall for all to see and discuss.  This instant gratification creates amazing deep thinking and promotes community.  By reading each others thoughts and ideas, differences melt and students see that they all have similar fears, worries, and hopes.  For those reluctant writers, they may step up their writing when they see the great work other students are doing.  \n\nI have used Elmos in other classrooms and the atmosphere was very open and supportive.  Students felt like their voices were heard and they were empathetic to their classmates.  Their writing improved at lightening speed.  I was able to get students samples right away to illustrate my teaching point, such as writing with voice, or great leads. \n\nYour gift will ensure my students voices are heard everyday.  It will help me reach all 120 students, which is currently a great challenge!  Students will not only improve their writing, increase their engagement, but also become more open and honest with each other. I realize it seems like a large investment for one class, but why shouldn't my kids be exposed to technology that is offered in richer school districts?  Perhaps my kids are in greater need of it--and you could make this dream a reality."

These songs also utilize many of the sight words that we work on in kindergarten.  These songs are fun and students love to sing them over and over again.  \n\nThe materials for this project include the Sing To Read Color and Sing to Read Number Word set from Frog Street Press.  These sets include a CD and the big books for each color and number word.  In addition, the students will make a take-home version of the big book.  My request also includes the posters that go along with the sets.  \n\nI already have the Alphabet Sing to Read collection and my students love it.  I would love to give them the same experience with their color words and number words.

I only hope that I can supply them with the tools they need to be successful in not only, but also in high school and college. \n\nThis computer is for the students, not the teacher. In this day in age, students are becoming more technologically advanced than their teachers. This computer will enable my students to explore their technology skills in our math classroom. My students will be able to make videos, create presentations, make songs about math, play games that reinforce concepts, learn concepts through the use of the Internet, and so much more. Learning math with a computer can challenge the strong students and motivate those who have room for improvement.  Each student will be able to benefit from this computer. \n\nYou and one computer can make such a difference in our classroom.

These are things others may have learned naturally through countless bedtime stories by Mom or Dad, but we have to explicitly teach them here. They're just as incredibly bright and inquisitive as students in the more affluent suburbs and other parts of the city. We just start in a different place. \n\nThese sets of board books will allow us to begin exploring literacy together as a class. We will learn how to hold the books together and turn one page at time. We read each book for about a week before moving on to a new one. This gives the students time to become familiar with the story and ""read"" along. They're incredibly proud to show their parents their reading (even if it's repeating a memorized story) and the only thing eclipsing that pride might be the pride of their parents when they see it.  \n\nThese resources are incredibly valuable to giving my students a strong beginning in literacy. They allow us to give them an important introduction to reading, and this activity is one of our favorite things to do as a class. "

We have a wonderful document camera to project work, but we need a laptop computer in order to use online resources. \n\nWe have approximately 675 students in our K-5 school.  We have over a dozen languages spoken, as well as ethnic and economic diversity.  Approximately 30% of our students are eligible for free/reduced lunch.  Our school and neighborhood community is strong, as evidenced by our fall carnival, school musicals, and parent involvement.  My class of 31 energetic first graders are in a classroom built for 20 children, so every square inch is utilized and organized for individual, partner, small group, and whole class learning.  Having a laptop in the classroom would free up precious space and captivate the students' attention as we visit various educational learning sites. \n\nAccess to the Internet would provide my students with more opportunities for learning and engagement. For instance, Houghton-Mifflin, our textbook supplier has on-line support materials  that many students either aren't aware of or do not have access to at home.  There are ""e-manipulatives"", games, illustrations of vocabulary words, re-teaching of concepts, and more.  These resources spark their attention and learning opportunities.  In addition there are a multitude of online learning sites, educational videos, and engaging games.  These sites will provide additional support to all the students, especially the ones who are struggling with English as a second language, as well as those with a limited vocabulary or life experiences. \n\nPlease consider donating to this project so that my students can benefit from current technology.  We already have a document camera.  We just need a laptop to really maximize the full potential of technology for my eager, energetic group of first graders! "

Our school is a Title I school that has to meet the needs of very diversified learners and the money doesn't always stretch as far as we would like. My students love using technology in the classroom and finding new ways to make learning fun. They are very creative and eager to learn and at the same time strive for independence. That's why this program would be a great tool in helping them establish that independence and learning.  \n\nThe Hot Dots program I want for my classroom will help my students become more independent learners. It reinforces each of the strands we study in Reading and the Science cards are phenomenal because my students will have a constant review of key concepts taught during the school year. With so much dependent on testing, the Science and Reading cards will help keep the main concepts we have learned about in the front of their memories allowing them to completely retain it and be able to use it again in the future. It will also help me implement a complete Balanced Literacy classroom by teaching via cross-curricula. \n\nThe difference I believe this program will make with my students is the absolute feeling of success when they are able to recall and implement strategies independently that were taught in class. That feeling of success for my students is indescribable and what all classroom teachers strive for.  "

This is not very conducive to modern learning.  \n\nMy students deserve better. These are the future leaders of our world. We are a public urban high school that draws students from all over the city, and has the socioeconomic diversity that modern urban living present. These students are driven, focused, and highly dedicated. They amaze me on a daily basis with their understanding of and observation about our society, its history, and its future. We are consistently ranked among the best in our district and state in academics, athletics, and extracurricular. It really is an honor to work with this group of kids.  \n\nEven though my students are high achievers, we still suffer from the unfortunate curse of under-funding. There is no money for the little niceties that have a direct (albeit casual) impact on learning. The desks in my room are HORRIBLE. Most of them have been in the school for at least 50 years. The seats are hard inflexible plastic. They are connected by metal bars to desktop surfaces that are warped, chipped, and permanently stained with decades old markings (several have bold black numbers written on them by a former teacher who used to refer to students by desk number...fits nicely with my ""prison seat"" description...urgh!). These desks are rigid and designed for students to sit in rows and be talked at-this is not how my classroom operates. \n\nYou can literally free my students (to move and wiggle about during their learning activities.) I'm asking you to help me make our classroom a place where students are physically comfortable, and furniture can be reconfigured for a variety of working/learning situations. These tables and chairs will make a huge impact on their learning; you can be a part of that process. "

My students are hard working, eager to learn, and unfortunately lack the resources needed for our class. It is very difficult to learn a subject when a large portion of the curriculum is based in the microscopic world and you have no access to that world. \n\nI am requesting a class set of microslide viewers as well as the microslides. With these resources, we will be able to see differentiated cells. We will see cells in the stages of mitosis. We will view the stages of photosynthesis and will be able to see the structure of the cell membrane. Affording students the opportunity to view the actual structures and processes involved in our curriculum will increase their learning and retention exponentially. \n\nWe struggle daily to teach in an environment with limited to no resources, and students struggle to remain engaged. Too often I find myself explaining why we can't do things, and can see the disappointment as discouragement sets in and they slowly lose interest in learning. This equipment can literally bring a new world into view, and because it is not consumable will help students for years to come. Thank you for considering us "
Having Fun With Phonemic Awareness,"My students need a portable CD player, word detective sliders, and a Listen & Learn Phonemic Awareness program to build phonemic awareness skills.

This is the challenge facing my monolingual & bilingual students as they try to master early reading skills such as phonemic awareness & phonics to become independent readers. \n\nMy Kindergarten class consists of 17 students, 15 of whom are bilingual and of Hispanic descent. Our school is an inner-city Renaissance school, meaning 90% or more of our families qualify for free lunch. Most of my students entered with no pre-school experience, and many have limited background experiences which naturally develop language and oral vocabulary in either language. My students have very diverse personalities which range from vocal and impulsive, to extremely quiet and shy, almost to the point of being non-verbal. The majority are eager to learn, but often lack the confidence to participate and join in whole-group lessons and activities. They are more inclined to interact when working one-on-one with me, or during a non-structured activity such as social centers or outdoor play. Parents are supportive and want their students to be successful, however, in many homes students must speak in Spanish and are not able to practice oral language heard and developed in class. \n\nMy students need a portable CD player, word detective sliders, and a Listen & Learn Phonemic Awareness program to build phonemic awareness skills. These resources will benefit ALL students, in particular, ELL students who need every available opportunity to be immersed in hearing the English language. The visuals are clear, simple, & represent common objects (cat, pig, ball) that are easily identifiable. This program also allows me to differentiate instruction to meet student needs. Struggling students will work on basic skills such as Initial Sounds, while high achievers will be challenged with higher-order skills such as Sound Switch and Medial Vowels. Most important, the write & wipe cards allow for easy correction of errors as responses are self-checked in a totally risk-free environment, allowing students to gain confidence as they experience success working independently. The CD player is compact & has the capability to run on batteries, making it accessible to all students regardless of seating around the room. The Word Sliders will provide an easy transition into phonics as students will blend sounds in simple CVC words. \n\nMy students are drawn to technology, & these age-appropriate materials will provide highly interactive & engaging lessons. Students will work independently on a targeted skill, while I instruct small guided reading groups. Following lessons with the Listen & Learn program, I will conduct informal assessments to determine a need for additional practice & support, or move on to another area within phonemic awareness. This program will be beneficial in guiding my instruction to meet student needs. "

This is how I imagine my students feeling. Talking is the key to many aspects of daily life.  Having language cards available for my students would really help them acquire new words and begin the road to understanding and using communication. \n\nI teach preschool children in North Carolina(ages 3-4) who have been diagnosed having Autism.  The school is made up of children who all have some type of disability. My students are wonderful and I love the job I do!  The most exciting thing about my students is that they all have some language or the potential for language.  I believe early intervention is the key...if you can reach and teach them early, they are able to acquire so much more.  Everyday I see growth in my students and it is so meaningful to watch their eyes light up and see the smiles on their faces when they are able to verbally tell you something they could not before.  Everyone wants to talk and my children are no different, they just need more training to do so.  I run an Adapted Behavior Analysis model in my room which means that my students learn the most effective when drilled with information.  They acquire new skills and new words daily using picture cards and verbal behavior methods. \n\nI cannot put into words how much these materials mean for my children...but I will try. Many children with Autism are visual learners. They need to see the object or picture and hear it paired with the verbal word to make the connection in the brain. If I say the word ""cat"" my students will repeat ""cat"" but they do not necessarily make the connection of word to object in the brain. They need to see a picture of a cat and hear the word over and over to make this connection concrete. We also use language cards to see how many words our students have acquired and retained over the course of the year. Having a variety of these picture cards would make learning language so much quicker and more purposeful to my students. I love seeing the growth my students can make not only week to week but day to day. A variety of these sets will give me multiple pictures of each item so my students will also learn to generalize the information they have learned. \n\nYour donation to my class of alphabet sound cards, vocabulary skill builder cards, early language concept kits, and a literature based learning center would make a world of difference when teaching my students language.  My students show so much potential to have the ability to talk and that is SO important to the rest of their social, self-help and cognitive development. By learning language my students will have endless opportunities. Thank you so much for reading about how to help my class. "

Immediate access to information will greatly enhance their ability to make a positive impact on the world. \n\nThe Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate Psychology program enrolls over 220 students who are planning on attending institutions of higher learning.  Many of my students have attended universities such as MIT, Stanford, Harvard, The Military Academies, Yale, Columbia, Penn, and all of the UC's.  Many of them have already begun to make an impact as they have written novels, attained national status athletically, developed community service projects, and have earned prestigious leadership positions. \nOur students have great potential for making an impact on the world.  Newsweek rates our school in the top 2% of schools in the U.S.  We are a comprehensive high school with over 3500 students enrolled.  The positive climate of the school is driven by our guiding principles found in the acronym, SPIRIT.  Scholarship, Passion, Integrity, Reflection, Involvement, and Teamwork are embedded into life on campus and is genuinely reflected in the exemplary actions of our students. \n\nThis course provides hands-on, active, and collaborative strategies that engage students in empowering and meaningful learning.  We make good use of antiquated texts and the scheduling of aging computers in our limited computer lab settings.  Enhancing our resources with immediate Internet access will exponentially ignite the quality of learning in our classroom.  For example, a current practice in our course is Non-fiction Literature Circles.  This cooperative strategy has allowed students to own their learning. We are limited to textbook and copied documents.  The rate at which students could access information through the internet for both core articles and supportive data, will greatly enhance our results.  In most cases of study in this course, having immediate access to the internet will positively impact the breadth, quality, and intrinsic value of learnt curriculum.  Infusing Chromebooks will unleash the potential of these most talented students to do special things. \n\nAnything that encourages students to strive for their dreams is worth considering.   Ultimately, increased access to information will encourage future contributions to the general good.  One of my students, who will attend MIT, wants to be a biomedical researcher.  His dream is to make a discovery that will help people, whether it contributes to a cure for cancer or solves Parkinson's.  Chromebooks for classroom access will positively impact the potential for my students to achieve their dreams. "

We are learning to analyze different foods for the health benefits and fabric fibers ""Just like on CSI!"".  Students can decide for themselves, using healthy eating criteria, whether food is healthy and how fibers are analyzed. \n\nWe know that America is facing an obesity epidemic.  However, most students do not know how to tell if a food is actually healthy or not!  Students can bring their own food packages, view them on the screen, through the document camera, and discuss together why a food is ""good for you"" or not.  They are also enthralled with the science on ""CSI"" and want to know how they can tell what kind of fiber it is by looking or through chemical reactions.  Now we can decide ""Just like on TV!""  This camera will help the students to all be more engaged in the lesson, because it will relate to their own lives and interests - not just what the teacher thinks will be interesting.\n   We use these lessons to reinforce math and science lessons!  What better way for a student to understand percentages, than to all look at a magnified food label and calculate the percentage of calories from fat?  Through this camera, we will be able to look at fabrics and weaves together to determine what fibers are used. \n\nI believe that obesity stems more from ignorance of what is healthy food and what is the proper amount of food than any other reasons.  Educating students and their families about HOW to make these crucial decisions about what they eat is the key to future health and well-being.  This document camera will help us project a wide variety of food labels onto the screen and analyze them together, reinforcing math skills and analytical thinking skills developed in science classes.\n   The ""CSI"" fibers lessons are just plain fun and help the students understand the science behind what they see on television.

What about the first time you had a chance to use an Apple iPad? All children seem to gravitate towards the newest and greatest technology. With a new iPad, I would be able to use this new technology to teach my kindergarten and first graders during small and center time. They would be able to download apps and programs to help them with phonemic awareness, phonics, and fluency.  The iPad would also assist with pinpointing those students who need additional assistance. The sky is the limit! The possibilities for learning are endless! \n\nBy giving to this project, you will be able to give my fantastic students access to technology they may never be able to access outside of school. The best part is this project will be used from year to year so the impact of the iPad will benefit many students in the years to come! "

I have also requested more hands on activities for our math groups. I've asked for materials for students working at table, while another group works at the interactive whiteboard, and another group works with the teacher.  All of the materials I've asked for will be wonderful additions to fulfill our learning targets.\n \n\nMy students are an appreciative bunch.  They are thrilled over almost everything already, being first graders.  However, the interactive materials I'm asking for will just send them to the moon!

Creative and Imaginative Readers Crave Fantastic Fiction,"Coraline"" is a rich, imaginative novella that brings a fantasy world to life.  It is the story of a little girl who escapes to the Other World, where the world is, at first, more caring. She soon discovers the Other World is not what is seems, and Coraline must use her...","My students need a class set (25) of the novella, Coraline by Neil Gaiman. ","Do you remember what it was like to be in middle school?  My students face the typical challenges of being adolescents on top of a low school budget and high poverty at home. I want to give my less successful readers a high interest novel that sparks their interest, creativity, and love of books. \n\nMy 7th grade students are smart and creative readers and writers who come from high poverty situations. Most of them qualify for Free and Reduced Meals (FARMS) at school, and many of them come from highly chaotic homes and neighborhoods.  They come to school to gain the skills and knowledge that they need to get into a good high school, and go onto college or successful careers.  Our school, however, is facing a budget crisis, and new materials are hard to come by.  I teach 85 7th graders, who range from 3rd grade to 11th grade reading levels. Finding reading materials that challenge and engage every student in my classroom is a struggle, but it is absolutely necessary in ensuring that they all learn.  \n\n""Coraline"" is a rich, imaginative novella that brings a fantasy world to life.  It is the story of a little girl who feels small and powerless in a world of grown-ups, so she escapes to the Other World, where the world is, at first, more interesting and caring. She soon discovers the Other World is not what is seems, though, and Coraline must use her wits to escape. The story, with themes that deal with dark family and childhood issues, is one that I believe many of my students can relate to. Also, my students love to read fantasy. Many of my students are reluctant readers, and some are currently reading below grade level.  They simply need more opportunities to read and write. Providing these students with high-interest reading materials such as ""Coraline"" in language arts is a big step toward increasing their vocabulary, reading comprehension, and even writing skills.  \n\nYour donation will go toward supporting reluctant readers in my classroom.  These are the students who, as they go onto the early years of high school, are more likely to drop out because of the frustrating academic challenges that they face.  The reading interventions that take place in my classroom play a key role in many of my students' attitudes toward school later on.   "

Yep, these words were actually heard in my classroom, and the sad part is that for many of my Kindergarteners, this taunt is right on the money. \n\nMy students come from all around the globe and speak 8 different languages at home, but they all have one thing in common.  Not one of them is getting the exercise they need to live a healthy lifestyle.  Most of them spend their time at home plopped in front of the TV.  That is why it is critical that they are up and moving during their recess and PE times at school. \n\nMy children do not need a lot to inspire an active physical life; they are after all only four and five years-old.  But right now we have one half inflated play ball to get them moving.  While it is incredibly cute watching 24 kids chase after the limp ball like puppies, most end up sitting against the wall in a matter of minutes as they never get a turn with the ball.  Imagine how much cuter it would be watching children work cooperatively at an organized game like soccer or basketball.  They have the energy and the desire to get moving, but they need the tools to help them do it. I am requesting the basics needed to start the children moving; a basketball hoop and balls, a soccer net and balls, and some flying discs. \n\nWhile all 160 kindergarten students at our site would benefit from the equipment provided by this project, I am especially eager to see my heavier students have the opportunity to get up and moving.  These are the students whose healthy lifestyle choices today will pay dividends for the rest of their lives.  You can help in our fight to establish good habit now that will last a lifetime. "
Help Save Space in my Art Classroom!,"This piece of furniture will be very valuable in our busy classroom.

Most of my students are low income and second language learners. Many of them do not have access to high quality art supplies. \n\nI love teaching art. But admittedly, space and organization is always an issue. I work very hard to bring my students tons of amazing art experiences and expose them to a variety of art supplies and media. But storage space is at a premium in our classroom. As many teachers know, there just seems to never be enough room for everything. But that doesn't mean that I should stop buying new supplies, just because I don't have the space to store them. Additionally, with over 500 students coming in and out of my classroom each week, our supplies are always being misplaced. I have good cabinet space, but I need to put common supplies, such as glue and scissors in an easy to reach place. I have very limited table and counter space, therefore leaving materials out can be a challenge. I want my students to see that an artists' space can be clean and organized, while also being ergonomic. I don't want to have to stack supplies in boxes and leave them on the floor. \n\nIn order to maximize the space in our classroom and allow students to have access to many supplies, I am asking for a Space-Saver Teaching Center from Lakeshore, which is a hardwood unit that combines 2 teaching easels and tons of storage space…in one incredible center! The easy-rolling, 4-sided center has a blank magnetic write & wipe board on front…and a lined magnetic write & wipe board on back. Plus, there are handy shelves below each board that are accessible from either side. And, there’s lots of additional storage space on each side of the center—including slotted compartments for big books or charts! There are even handy rings on front and back to hang pocket charts. This teaching center is tall and slender enough to fit in the corner, yet will hold an entire cabinet's worth of art supplies. \n\nThis piece of furniture will be very valuable in our busy classroom. It will help me stay organized, while allowing students to see the supplies and get them when needed without having to ask me to open one of the cabinets. I also love that it includes 2 more white boards! As most teachers experience, I am always running out of room on the white board and need more space. I think one of the keys to successful teaching is being organized. Please help me keep my classroom clean and organized by donating this space saving teacher center to my art classroom. I know my students will be very grateful!"

They are normal high school students, curious about science and eager to learn. Our school has a high percentage of socio-economically disadvantaged students.  We are a public highschool in Califonia that has only basic technology for student use.  We do not have all of the equipment that a well-funded school has. \n\nOur families struggle to pay the rent. Our students aspire to go on to college. Many are ill-prepared because they have not had exposure to or experience with technology as tool for learning or as a tool for recording, analyzing or presenting scientific data.  The world of science outside of high school is science using technology and instrumentation.  Our students leave here ill-prepared for science at that level. They learn the concepts, but have no experience with the tools needed express or record data. \n\nThe Flip video camcorders will allow my Physics students to document and review their experiments. Video is active and physics should be active.  They would be using a tool of ""real science"", video. Just as the TV Mythbusters do, they could do the experiment and then review the video to check their results.  They could speed up or slow down the video to review results.  They could use their video as evidence and data proving or disproving their hypotheses.  Video would bring excitement to the lab experiments. \n\nYour donation to this project will bring something to the classroom that I cannot, the ability to use video as a tool for learning.

Our school has mostly free and reduced lunch students. \n\nThese students need everything they can get to help them to start the new school year with some of the basic supplies. They need lots of help because our school can't supply materials for them, nor can our parents. As a teacher, it is so sad to see students who come in and have nothing of their own to start them writing and drawing. Oh how they love to draw and tell their stories to me! But without markers, pencils, and paper, it's almost impossible for this to happen. \n\nWith the supplies I have asked for, my little ones can draw and tell me about their experiences on their first day of school. They love to draw and practice writing their alphabet and numbers. These supplies will  benefit  each child because each child needs to express themselves so they will have an equal chance. They will learn how to hold a pencil in their tiny hands because some students come without that ability. I remember one student asked me last year, ""May I take a pencil home, because my mama doesn't have a pencil at our house?"" I almost cried! It is so sad, but true. These supplies that I am requesting will make them feel like they belong with the group that does have supplies. Supplies will allow these students to have a chance to draw, color, write and learn, so that will be become great students! \n\nPlease support my project. It's their first year of school and I want it to be a year they will remember for the rest of their lives. I want it to be a happy memory for them. My students need something positive in their lives.

In recent years, our district has experienced gargantuan deficits, causing many cutbacks. Unfortunately, as a Title 1 school in an area of severe poverty, ""non-essential"" items, like class sets of books, are not a priority. It is believed that the one copy in the library is enough, not that having students read along will increase their fluency and reading comprehension. My students are all on the free and reduced meal plans, and survive in areas most people would avoid just driving through. In spite of all this, they come to school every day eager to learn.

Help Us Share What We Have!,"Remember the pure excitement you felt when you played your band instrument for the very first time?

Only 25% of Hispanic Minneapolis students graduate from high school. We are a public charter school proving that all children are capable of success, regardless of zip code, race, or other factor. 95% of our students qualify for free or reduced lunch, and 99% of our students are students of color. 100% of our students are on the path to college. \n\nMost schools are choosing to cut the arts in an attempt to save money, and while we don't have the budget to fully support it,  we value the arts and the tremendous impact music involvement can have on students' overall academic success. The majority of our students are not able to afford to rent or purchase band instruments, but we aim to still provide equitable access to the joy of music making. We're reaching out the local community for instrument donations, and we need mouthpieces to stretch what we do get. \n\nIn January, we want to start band with our fifty 7th graders, but we only have 12 donated instruments to share . Having mouthpieces and reed guards will protect the community's generosity and provide access to an instrument for our hard working scholars. \n\nBy donating to this project, you are providing an opportunity for young, deserving scholars to learn an instrument and the accompanying lessons of character, hard work, and community that they wouldn't otherwise ever get.

You may face these kinds of texts daily.  My students need exposures to these types of texts so that they can gain the reading skills needed to comprehend them. \n\nI have an active group of third graders who love to learn true facts about the world around them.  They enjoy reading nonfiction texts and talking about what they have discovered.  \n\nWe are a Title I school with dedicated teachers and staff. All staff work hard to help students be successful and to promote a school community of respect. \n\nI am requesting a set of high-interest nonfiction texts.  These texts include a newspaper, magazine article, brochure, and an internet page.  These are the types of texts that students will read as they go throughout their lives.  These texts will help build the necessary skills to read nonfiction texts and learn about the world around them.\n\nI am also requesting fluency and comprehension partner scripts.  Students need to practice reading aloud to build their fluency. Fluency is an important and necessary skill to build as they face more and more challenging texts. \n\nThis project will make a difference to my students by helping to build background knowledge and providing them with the reading skills needed to read fluently and comprehend text.  These skills can be applied to any text they face throughout their lives. "
In Need of a Laminator!!!,"Where I currently use contact paper to protect materials, my true desire is a laminator to protect the material.

Once the material is created, it needs to be protected in some manner, as my students need to study these materials daily, which can cause ""wear and tear"".

Books take students out of their day-to-day worlds and open doors of adventure.  Reading books on a nook will greatly enhance this opportunity.  By showing students books are available in a variety of media, a love of reading will be increased.  A nook will be exciting and fun for the students to use.  When students are excited about reading, they WILL read!  As a teacher, it is my hope that every child will love reading because through reading one prepares for all of life!  The gifted learners will use this nook to strengthen their reading skills and expand their reading base.  Students will be able to use the nook for both independent and required reading assignments.  What an awesome opportunity to enable children to develop a love of reading! \n\nThrough your generous donations, this project will inspire young readers!

They are capable of so much more than they can produce because of these limitations.  However, they are still required to take the same state tests as their non-disabled peers.  With this technology, I will be able to teach my students how to experience the independence of creating compositions without limitations.  They will be able to express themselves freely and fully. \n\nMy students will use the voice-to-text feature on the iPad to write responses to literature, journal their ideas, and to create compositions.  Previously, my students would dictate their ideas to a scribe.  However, because the scribe could not keep up with the speed at which my students were speaking, many of their ideas were lost.  Or, my students would change their ideas, using the simplest of forms, so that it could be done quickly.  They would then have to wait for the scribe to finish before they could re-read what they had written.  This has been a painstaking process and my students felt their own frustration as well as mine.  If they were able to have access to their writing independently, my students would finally experience the joy of seeing their ideas on paper. \n\nMy students need access to voice to text writing tools so they can write texts even though they have disabilities which limit their use of fine motor muscles.\n\nAs Ann Landers said, ""it is not what you do for your children, but what you have taught them to do for themselves that will make them successful human beings.""

They are part of a small Montessori program at a high-needs school in the city. The atmosphere in my room is one of curiosity and concentration.  They are very interested in science and biology in particular, as well as art. \n\nThe students will be learning all about the inner workings on the various animal bodies, but also the animal kingdom and how each animal evolved throughout time. However, the use of the materials in this request will be to take the learning to the next level. The students will have to meticulously document the parts in drawings and photos. They will be practicing the essential skill of presentation and attention to detail when they cut and paste their descriptions, titles and drawings on the project display boards. The hand work and hand eye coordination are a struggle for 9-10 year olds and the expectations are high. We emphasize beauty and pride in presentation in Montessori and this will fall in line with our every day work goals. \n\nThere is no budget for my classroom as well as little to no science or art supplies.

They attend an all special education school, and many travel long distances to get here. They come from neighborhoods spanning the city, and most receive free or reduced lunches. School is very challenging for most of my students and most have failed in a traditional school setting. They are not all strong readers but they love the opportunity to perform and be dramatic. I have seen many students who have opened up and taken chances when they were given the chance to perform. Students, who never wanted to read aloud in class, or raise their hand to give an opinion, were jumping at the chance to show off their acting skills. Students, who could not stay in their seat were channeling that energy into ""becoming"" a character and using that emotion when saying their lines. For many of the students, it gives them an opportunity to do well in a class and have fun while doing it. They are a very special group of students. \n\nMy students need 10 musician's podiums to stand behind, when we practice and perform our Readers Theater scripts.

We will be able to practice our scripts more professionally and they will grow in the confidence of knowing that they will be well prepared to give more public performances of their work. They will be able to look like other Reader's Theater troupes that they have seen and feel a sense of pride knowing that they are true ""Actors."" These stands will be especially useful for the one student in our troupe that uses Braille to read her scripts. Without having something to put her scripts on, it has been very difficult for her to keep her place in the reading and follow along. This has been a source of frustration for her, and I would like to see that frustration diminished. \n\nHaving these podiums in our classroom, as a result of having this project funded, would mean the world to my students. They would be able to continue doing what they love, and they would be able to feel more confident doing it.  Please help our classroom, we will be forever grateful & each time we use the podiums we will think of the kindness shown to us. "

","I am a 6th grade teacher at a public school in Washington, DC.  Most of my students are immigrants or children of immigrants from Central America. While many of the students struggle as they learn English, they are all quickly taken in by the appeal of the fast food industry in the United States. These students, similar to many young people and their families, eat tremendous amounts of fast food. It is inexpensive, accessible, attractive and, of course, tastes great. \n\nBy reading Eric Schlosser’s book, Chew on This, and studying our own nutrition, the project will teach students about the short and long-term health risks involved in eating fast food.  Students will also get an inside look at the fast food industry, and how they, as young people, are instrumental to its success. \n\nChew on This is also a positive way to engage students in reading non-fiction.  Students will learn to identify the main idea and supporting details, as well as articulate the author’s point of view.  They will be able to transfer these skills, attained through a subject matter of great interest to them, to other non-fiction texts they will encounter. \n\nThe study of this book will take place throughout the year, and be applied to many different aspects of the curriculum.  In math, we will make graphs showing the sugar and fat content of different foods. We will examine our daily diet with the recommended food pyramid issued by the United States Department of Agriculture. In social studies, we will map the location of origin of many of the foods we eat. \n\nThe most powerful application of this book is in the area of literacy.  \nSixth graders are being taught to critically analyze what they read, as well as what they are exposed to in the area of media, including television and advertising. My hope is that, after reading this book, students will become more educated and critical consumers.\n\nIndividual or group projects coming out of this study may include doing additional research on the subject, launching a campaign for healthier school lunches, sponsoring a debate on the pros and cons of eating fast food, or becoming more active within their families on the food choices they make. \n"

Over 95% of the students at this school qualify for the free lunch program, and over 90% are achieving below grade level standards in both English language arts and mathematics. The art programs at my school are minimal and lack funding and development. \n\nMiddle school students are at a crucial time in their lives when they begin to develop perceptions and ideas about themselves and the world around them that they will carry with them for the rest of their lives. The sad fact is that far too many students travel through their world with their eyes closed, unaware of the beauty, joy, hope, and sorrow that surrounds them. Their myopic vision and awareness prevents them from developing into fulfilled and self-recognized individuals and stunts their personal development. I hope to combat this through photography.\n\nPhotography forces an indivual to cast a receptive and perceptive eye upon their surroundings. Through the camera, students are begged to evaluate the world around them, and in doing this, they are able to develop understandings regarding the world around them that are informed by critical question and thought. This not only helps the student to understand their world, but it allows students to understand themselves within the context of their surrounding. Their self-awareness is heightened by their explorations, and they are then allowed to grow into fully realized individuals. This will be done through assignments aimed at specific themes and concepts: self, family, community, culture, social issues, personal values, change.\n\nPhotography is not only an avenue for self discovery, but is an excellent bridge between people.  Students will be given the chance to communicate with others through their work by sharing it with their school community. In doing this, I hope to build a sense of community that will help to shape the entire environment of the school and result in widespread change. \n\nIn this proposal I am asking for 4 digital cameras to be used by as many as 100 students throughout the school year. By incorporation technology through digital photography and the use of computers to process and manipulate the students' work, this program also seeks to equip students with skills that will aid students in this increasingly technological world. These are skills that students can carry with them into the world when persuing further education and careers.\n"

They are awesome little kids who just need a little bit of extra love, care, and support!   \n\nMany of my students have not had an early exposure to literacy at home.  That is why I feel it is partially my responsibility to give them this opportunity in my classroom.  I know that exposing them to a wealth of great books will open up their imaginations and allow them to develop a love of literacy. \n\nI am very passionate about books and have seen tremendous things happen as students develop a love of reading.  I feel that now is the best time to start, especially with the student population that I work with.  Too often, students with disabilities are given up on; I feel it's imperative that they're given the same types of opportunities for learning! "
High School Math - It's For Everyone!,"Math, the most polarizing subject in high school. My high school is no different. I have students who would pass any math test I give them, no matter the quality of my instruction. But what about...",My students need two tablets and two pairs of headphones for math class.,"Math, the most polarizing subject in high school. My high school is no different. I have students who would pass any math test I give them, no matter the quality of my instruction. But what about the others? Should they be left in the dust because math is not innately easy to them? The answer is no. \n\nSmall schools do have some shortcomings. Those shortcomings are a more rigid schedule (usually only one of each class is offered), less opportunity for acceleration, no tutoring services, and a smaller variety of class options.\n\nBut small is not the only way to describe our school. We are rural, where agriculture is our driving economic force. This in turn makes our school a high needs area, or a high poverty area.  I would guess that most of our kids don't know they quality as high needs. In fact our school does amazing things for others. In six years we have raised $23,000+ for cancer; other schools our size raise about $600 per year. \n\nThe two tablets and pairs of headphones requested will allow students to watch video lessons in class to help with acceleration and tutoring services. \n\n(1) ""Math is difficult for me"" - In a traditional classroom you have 45 minutes to get the math lesson or get left behind. Students that are struggling with my new system will be required to watch the video lesson and take notes BEFORE class begins. This will serve as a net to catch struggling students. \n\n(2) ""I cant take the classes I want because the schedule is too rigid"" - With my new system, students can choose to take a ""Flipped Math Class"", where they will watch video lessons as homework and do homework in class with me. This enables me to have more than one math subject in the same math class (Ex. Period 2 is geometry and Algebra 2), thus opening up the schedule. \n\n(3) ""Math is too easy, I want to take a harder class"" - In a small school this creates a problem because the harder class that the student wants to take might be during the during the same time as the required English class. However, with the ""Flipped Math Class"", as mentioned in (2), that student would have more options to accelerate his/her learning. \n "

","Vince Lombardi once said, ""Leaders are made, they are not born. They are made by hard effort, which is the price which all of us must pay to achieve any goal that is worthwhile."" I agree with Mr. Lombardi, and will go a step further to say, ""Readers are made, they are not born."" \n\nDue to consecutive low test scores--including less than 25% achieving proficient in reading--my school was chosen to be a turnaround school in Washington, DC.  This year, myself and the turnaround staff begin a five-year plan that will work to ensure that our students-- all low-income-- will achieve at high levels.  More importantly, that they will be on path to college and lifelong success. \n\nAs the 3rd grade literacy teacher, I will use Readers Workshop to empower my students to become avid readers.  Readers Workshop is a lauded curriculum nationwide, and is used in many of the nation's most successful charter schools. \n\nA huge component of Readers Workshop is a leveled classroom library.  Students select books on their reading levels during independent reading time each day in an effort to give students the freedom to choose books that are of interest to them.  It focuses on reading comprehension and teaches students to critically analyze text by asking questions and making connections. \n\nAdditionally, Readers Workshop includes peer conferences, teacher conferences with students, and a sharing component.  Each part helps students to become independent readers outside of the classroom. \n\nAs a recent DC implant, your help in building our classroom library is very timely since many of my classroom books could not be transported with me.  My readers are counting on you! \n\nAll students deserve quality books that they'll enjoy reading.  I'm sure you still remember those great books you read as a child.  My personal favorite is Dr. Seuss' Oh the Places You'll Go.  Your generous support will help my students select their favorite books that they'll cherish a lifetime.  Thank you! "

Anytime one of my students finds a book that they like I try to get them more books by the same author to read.

Making our room as comfortable and inviting is key to me.  Learning starts with wanting to be there and inviting aspects. \n\nOur school district is reconfiguring our Elementary classrooms and many children are not only entering a new grade, with a new teacher, they are going to a whole new building in a different part of town.  I too am being uprooted and shifted to a new grade level with little to no classroom resources.  These children come from very low income households and are struggling not only economically as well as academically.  They are beautiful children who deserve so much so I will do whatever I can to get them the resources and ""extras"" they need and deserve. \n\nThese beautiful children deserve the best.  They do not have desks and work from tables so they have no place to store or keep their work organized so the organizer will help our class and the students keep organized.  As for the beanbags the children need places to sit when reading books in our book area.  They are currently sitting on the floor or can sit on plastic little chairs.  I am hoping making the book area an inviting place to go will make students want to go and read.  As for the phonics activities this is just another teaching tool for me to help these children build their literacy skills and unfortunately our district just can't afford new materials and these students deserve new resources every once in a while. \n\nThese few items will make a huge difference in our classroom.  The students are a great group of children who deserve a ""leg up"".  Many of us loose sight of the little things, and a few new items for the classroom reinforce what I try to instill in them which is every little thing counts and the harder we work the more we benefit. I only wish i could list more things for the kids to receive because their reactions to new items is more than words can say, Remember these little ones are our future "

I will be teaching first grade collaborative team teaching this upcoming September. Collaborative team teaching is a new educational approach where the class is comprised of 60% general education students and 40% students with special needs. My school is a Title I school and is in a low-income area. Currently 90% of the students receive free lunch.\n\nI work in an underprivileged Hispanic and African American neighborhood. As a teacher I feel I need more supplies in order to keep students learning and on task. Among the materials that I would like funding for are various series of books, specially selected for beginning readers.  The books are accompanied with cassette tapes that narrate the stories word for word.  This helps students become familiar with new words, word sounds, intonation and punctuation.  The big book collection includes both fiction and nonfiction stories.  These large books can be used for whole class and small group instruction.  The stories include simple, rhythmic language and wonderful illustrations.  The sight word readers provide predictable sentence patterns and helpful illustrations that support text.\n\nI plan to integrate the read along books as part of my listening center, which will focus on building students basic skills in reading.  The collection of big books will be used in the shared and guided reading portions of my day emphasizing on choral reading and more individualized skill building.  The sight word readers will be used in the reading center and in the classroom library to help students master common sight words.\n\nWorking with students with diverse needs is a challenging and rewarding job.  I would like to begin the new year with the supplies that will help me to meet this challenge as well as meet the needs of my students.  These books will be used in all aspects of the students learning not only during English Language Arts but across the curriculum in science, social studies, group work and independent work.\n"

Simple memories like listening to nursery rhymes should be a part of their young life. Giving every student the opportunity to imagine can open many doors.\n\nI will have taught at my elementary school for eight years when the 2011-2012 school year begins, and I cannot picture myself anywhere else. When my students enter my classroom, many are anxious and constantly concerned because of their difficult home lives, living conditions and parental influences. They struggle when it comes to trying new things and thinking outside of the box because they are not given time to pretend, imagine, think, play and enjoy the simple pleasure of enjoying a funny, interactive story at home. My students love listening to books that are humorous, colorful and that can put a smile on their faces. Furthermore, they enjoy reading these same stories to themselves with a stuffed animal or to a classmate for extra practice. Since they spend so much time worrying about adult issues, they don't have the opportunity to just practice reading fun, predictable stories. I feel that these nursery rhymes will open my students' eyes to another world, a world that can be enjoyable. \n\nI believe these nursery rhyme resources will help me to actively engage my students in predictable, funny, rhymes with happy endings. The DVD will allow my students to hear and see the nursery rhymes in the morning while they are eating breakfast. During the shared reading block, I will be able to read the variety of nursery rhyme books aloud. The students and I can find rhyming words, decode unknown words, sequence the nursery rhymes and even begin to talk about fact and fantasy. The possibilities are endless. Then when it is time for literacy centers, the students will be able to use the nursery rhyme kit, picture cards and memorable nursery rhyme characters to retell the rhymes to their classmates. Furthermore, I will be able to ask the students to create different endings to their favorite nursery rhymes during the writing block or even create their own funny rhymes. All of the nursery rhyme items can be used throughout the school year or as a month-long themed unit. \n\n \n\nThese nursery rhyme materials may seem simple, but I know they can be used to help open every student's imagination. I believe these funny stories will impact the way I teach and help every unique and special student learn. These nursery rhyme materials will be used during the 2011-2012 school year with my students and so many more in their future. Please remember, one book, one story, once character, and one moment can change a student's life. "

I believe that this is an experience that every child should have a memory of. I want to provide this experience to my three 6th grade science classes as well as the other 5 6th grade classes at our Middle School.  \n\nOur Middle School is a title one school, which means that many of the students would be very hard pressed to come up with the small amount of money it requires to visit the zoo. Many of the students I teach have never been once in their life. Since we discuss the ecosystem in science class, I believe that there would be no better way to teach this standard than to take students to the zoo so that they can observe animals in the habitats that nature intended for them. \n\nYour donations would provide entrance to the zoo as well as transportation. With this field trip, students will learn a great deal about animals and their habitats. Not only will each student learn a great deal but they will be able to have memories of a trip to the zoo that will last a lifetime. \n\nI can't imagine a childhood without a visit to the zoo. Providing an opportunity for students to leave their desks and experience nature will be a rewarding and educational experience for each of them. Also, this project will not only benefit my students but the entire 6th grade, which includes 186 diverse students. "

They love being introduced to these classic stories with the use of big books. \n\nMy students attend school in an urban school district. A large majority of my class are English Language Learners. Because of language barriers and job demands, many of my students are experiencing quality storytelling at home. I try to plan my literacy instruction around recreating these basic literacy experiences. The students LOVE hearing stories, poems, nursery rhymes, and songs. As we learn more letters and sight words, they are so excited to spot things they know in a book. Using big books for shared reading allows them a chance to connect these new understandings and develop an understanding of text and concepts of print. One of my favorite times of day is our shared reading. It has now become impossible to get through a reading of a story without a student noticing a word or letter they know! There are 19 very hungry readers in my classroom! \n\nI am requesting 5 sets of classic stories written in the big book format. Big books allow a reading experience where all students can participate. The big book helps recreate that storytelling process by providing access for each student. There is a block of time in every day dedicated to shared reading. Shared reading is a time for me to model a variety of practices, thinking, and reading strategies that good readers must do. Along with enjoying a quality story, the students learn all of the skills required to be literate. Big books are usually used for shared reading throughout an entire week with different teaching points addressed with each re-read. In following weeks, the big books can be used in independent literacy centers or as a familiar read in the classroom library. \n\nThis is my first year teaching kindergarten. I inherited a old set of big books from a now unused reading curriculum. However, I find myself scrambling around school begging and borrowing to use these classic big books.  I would love to have some of these stories available in my classroom to provide students with quality literacy experiences. I take the responsibility of teaching reading very seriously and look forward to seeing those little brains hard at work every day! "

They have spent their elementary years learning science straight from a textbook or have not learned science at all. Students lack excitement, curiosity, and a feeling of stewardship for the environment. \n\nStudents will use their lunchroom waste to create compost and compost tea for our hydroponic grow units.  Compost tea will be added to planters that grow lettuce, herbs and other plants using no soil.  Produce grown on school grounds will be used in our school cafeteria for school lunches.\n\nStudents will learn how to help the environment two ways.  First, students learn about alternative ways to grow food locally that does not impact our land.  Second, student learn about the benefits of composting and the impact of landfills on the land. \n\nI want to inspire my students and ignite a love of not only science but of learning and conserving.

They come to us from many different types of homes. Some students are living with extended families, single parents, or a two parent homes. Most families struggle financially, and are not able to provide school supplies for their students. This makes it difficult to complete projects in the classroom without the help of the community.\n\nMany of our students are exposed to inappropriate behaviors at home and in their neighborhood. They can quickly say the wrong thing to another person and not realize the effect it will have on someone else. Talking about emotions, apologizing, and doing the right thing are topics we discuss daily in our classroom. \n\nI am requesting several sets of fiction books and a variety of fiction books for my students to read with a partner. When students are able to work together in a safe environment, they are less likely to bully each other. Students will then participate in literature circles while reading a variety of fiction books. Finding a common experience for students to discuss will provide a safe learning environment. Students will be able to learn from each other and see the other person differently. This will help eliminate bullying types of behavior because students will learn to work together daily. Talking about books brings about great discussions! They love to share what they have learned! This will be possible in a cooperative literature circle that prevents bullying in our classroom. \n\nI like the quote I selected because I believe children who read will learn about many types of conflicts and resolutions through the characters in the stories. This will help them to solve their own personal conflicts appropriately. Children will also able to make connections with the characters in the books or the similar situations the characters have to deal with. Providing a safe learning environment for all of my students is my goal. "

Using the whiteboard can get the job done but a digital projector is a much more engaging and exciting learning tool!   \n\nMy students are a group of amazingly smart and inquisitive first graders that are enrolled in the dual immersion program at our school. They are simultaneously learning their core subjects in English and Spanish and have shown great growth emotionally and intellectually. Any donations will benefit forty students, as they switch classrooms half way through the day.  \n\nWe need a digital projector to display our classwork and learning in a way that is easily seen by the entire classroom. It will be used to show projects and ideas to their peers in all subjects language arts, math, science, and social studies. This technology will become an intricate part of our daily life.  \n\nYour donations will help step our classroom up to the 21st century. Exposure to a digital projector will also give an opportunity to students to use technology tools that they would otherwise not be unavailable due to the high-poverty population in our school.  "

Do you remember the neat music you got to discover while playing those shiny instruments? I do, but my students will not. \n\nI teach 600 inner city students in a gutted out boys locker room that is still used as a boys bathroom. We have no walls and it gets very noisy when classes are using the bathroom while I am trying to teach. My students are amazing kids, most have nothing and school is their ""safe and happy"" place. When they come to music, all they want to do is play the instruments. With little funding and older instruments, that are starting to fall apart, I am starting to run out of enough instruments for all the kids in a class. \n\nYou could make a difference in 600 students lives by giving them new shiny instruments to play in music class. If you could picture a class of 26-1st graders when they all are holding a drum in their hands, your heart would melt. My students deserve to have instruments to play so they can make up their own rhythms and add sounds to a story. They want to be part of the music with more than just a few old instruments and clapping their hands. \n\nAs a donor, you have the opportunity to make so many students happy. Remember how you felt when you got to play an instrument in music class. It is such a great feeling that every student deserves to have. "

It is difficult for me as a teacher to find the time to provide the extra help the students who struggle need. \n\nI have discovered a resource that will help me give extra practice in the skill of writing alphabet letters, one of the most important skills we introduce in kindergarten. The See and Write tutor shows the students how to write the letter on lines in step by step directions and then allows students time to practice on their own paper.  As part of this project I plan to target my students who are struggling learning to write letters. This practice can be done independently therefore freeing me and my assistant to work with other students who need extra practice on other skills. \n\nPlease consider funding my proposal.

My students have not had the opportunity to be exposed to many sensory enlightened experience.  These items will provide the chance. \n\nMy students attend a center for preschoolers with special needs in a public school system in Virginia. Students have a variety of delays and disabilities. They view themselves as typical children with needs,hopes and dreams. They may be 2-5 year old with disabilities, but they are like sponges.  They absorb everything they can from experiences and opportunities that are presented. The preschool age is when the most learning is done and the more experiences they have the better chance for a bright future of learning!  They are so appreciative of ANY equipment or materials they receive. Most of my students come from homes that are living paycheck to paycheck and do not have the extra funds to purchase  educational materials. That is where I am hoping that you come in. Many of the students have tactile issues  due to never being exposed to sensory materials. These materials will provide a glimpse into some sensory stimulation and create an example of how much fun they can have.\n\nSensory activities provide the positive sensations my students need to assist in all areas of development.  Language and learning skills are enhanced by the senses. By using these sensory items, I can teach vital concepts that are required at this age of development. With the personal sandbox, living aquarium, glow in the dark sand and swirly mats concepts such as action words (fast/slow), opposites(in/on/on off), colors and shapes. These items can be used as a class or alone. \n\nSensory activities are the cornerstone of learning.  By using their senses students learn by investigating and questioning what they feels, see, hear, taste and smell. This process gives the student the ground work and the tools necessary to adapt to every other learning situation he or she experiences the rest of his/her life. "

We have mostly low income families in our school and my class is fairly large with 32 kids. They are great kids though, hard working, polite, and if given the chance to learn they take it. We don't have a lot of money in our class budget and the resources we do have for our science class are not the best. These kids have wonderful personalities and if given the right materials combined with their work ethic they can really succeed. They just need the proper learning tools.  \n\nIn the 4th grade the students are suppose to become familiar with weather and weather patterns by making observations, predictions and so forth. The science kit I'm requesting will be used during our science class time and will help them learn the required lessons about weather as well as assist them in their charting of daily weather and making weather predictions. The kit is reusable, so I will be able to use it for future classes, which means it will help the learning of many-many kids over the years.  \n\nIn today's classroom we need up-to-date learning materials to make learning meaningful and engaging for our students. We don't do them any favors by teaching them with old, out-of-date materials that they will not see nor use in high school or college. A brand new science kit about weather will help make the lessons more interesting and memorable for them. It will spark interest about weather for so many and put them on a path where learning about our Earth is enjoyable for them.  "

Yet, my students are expected to meet the same educational standards as more affluent students of New York do. \n\n \n\nOur students are given research projects that require that they have access to computers and printers. Less than 25% of our students have computers with Internet access at home. When they do, they often lack the ability to print reports because they lack the funds to purchase paper, or printer ink cartridges. They must rely on the school's resources to complete their assignments. \n\nUnfortunately, our school has only one computer lab that is already overburdened. Our printers are old and often break-down due to over-usage. \n\nMy project will give students an opportunity to produce research projects and class assignments. A high volume printer/copier will give them an alternative way to ensure that they can complete their projects. \n\nMy Project: The research assignments I give my students are designed to prepare them for what they will do in college. They are not just about gathering information, but rather organizing, presenting and communicating what they have learned to others.\n \nThe printer/copier will also provide my students with diagrams, charts and other resource materials that will enhance the learning process. Many of my students are classified as Special Needs or English Language Learners. They need additional resources to understand the complex concepts discussed in biology. \n\n \n\nAnd lastly, as my school is located in ""Asthma Alley,"" absenteeism due to asthma attacks is quite high. Access to a printer will let me to copy and print the lesson plan and notes for students who could not attend class.

Reading the poetry in these anthologies will help them realize that other people have these thoughts and feelings, too. \n\nIt is very important for students to see other people sharing their thoughts and feelings.  Especially for these children, who have had to leave their home countries, learn a new language, and/or grow up in impoverished settings, this poetry will show them that they are not alone in their struggles.  Additionally, for those students who find essays and stories restrictive to their creativity, these anthologies will be inspirational and give them ideas about new forms of expression. "

My goal is to provide my students multiple opportunities to succeed in their learning as they discover their personal strengths. We know that early childhood education is linked to academic achievement - and my goals are to use these resources to provide quality programming with developmentally appropriate activities to stimulate the wide range of young learners in my classroom.\n\n\nThe materials that I have requested include games and activities such as 3-D shapes, magnetic counting and number sense boards, addition and subtraction learning stations, probability spinners, and hands on materials for the study of life cycles and seasons .  I have also requested a set of leveled readers so the science, social studies and math curriculum can be brought into our guided reading activities in a way that matches the student's independent reading levels. \n\nThe hands-on manipulatives and activities provided by this project will provide students with more successful learning experiences by providing them with the meaningful and fun activities they need during their critical stages of early concept development. I thank you in advance for your support of my Kindergarten classroom and our young learners! "
Access to e-Readers for Every 6th Grader!,"How important are reading and literacy to you? Imagine a life in which you dream of attending college, knowing it's the ticket to a better future, but reading is a constant struggle. That's the...",My students need 16 Nook e-readers so that every 6th grader at my school has access to this wonderful literacy technology.,"How important are reading and literacy to you? Imagine a life in which you dream of attending college, knowing it's the ticket to a better future, but reading is a constant struggle. That's the challenge facing many of our middle school students. \n\nApproximately 650 6th, 7th, and 8th graders attend our suburban middle school. Our attendance area includes some affluent families, many students from working middle class households, and an increasing number of students from low-income homes. Over 50% of our students now qualify for free or reduced lunch under federal poverty guidelines. And many kids come from homes where reading and literacy are scarce, and learning to read with fluency and ease is a struggle. Our school is rich with texts, expansive classroom libraries, and a dedicated and talented staff who nurture individualized reading and writing using a workshop model that focuses on each reader as an individual. Our students aspire to be literate, and most love coming to school. Though after-school sports have been cut recently due to budget issues, we have a wide range of after-school programs and activities which many of our students participate in. \n\nLast year we received four Nook e-Readers to pilot in one classroom. The hope was that this technology would appeal to reluctant readers who were struggling to engage in printed texts. The experiment was successful, and data collected at the end of the 2011-2012 school year showed growth in quantity and reading comprehension for those students who regularly chose to read using the Nook e-Readers. But these devices were only available in one of our four 6th grade language arts classrooms. Now, we're ready to expand the use of e-Readers for independent reading to the other rooms so that all in-coming 6th graders have access to this technology. Each e-Reader will be loaded with a number of highly engaging young adult novels covering the wide range of reading abilities in the classroom. Each student is assessed several times using the Fontas and Pinnell Guided Reading Levels assessments, and each e-Reader will contain books from levels L-Z, so that every student can access the right book. \n\nI love teaching middle school, and 6th grade especially is such an inspiring and formative age. For many of my students, this is the year they point to and say ""I became a reader."" But many of our kids fail to ever engage with books, and if they don't acquire that sense of personal agency and empowerment in middle school, life can quickly become discouraging and bleak. Technology like e-Readers has the power to engage reluctant readers and literally turn their lives around. "

My children will be exposed to great books while being read to through CDs. They will follow the print and learn sight words while learning to love books and reading. \n\nI have 22 low to average income students with a variety of backgrounds. They are at multiple reading levels and abilities. They love learning and enjoy both fiction and non fiction reading materials. They will sit and listen to me read all day. This, however, is not possible, but with these CD players they could have books read to them during their free choice or when they finish their work while I'm working with small groups of children. \n\nI have collected a large number of books with a CD that reads the words with expression and voices, signals to turn pages and engages children's minds. The children use their fingers to follow the reading and learn many of their sight words. This will allow me to have a listening center for the children to use any time they want to work on reading during the day. \n\nOver the past 5 years all of the CD players in my room have worn out. I purchased them with my own money, but with economic times I can not afford to replace them at this time. PLEASE consider helping us with this project. I have saved all of the head sets to use and my rechargeable batteries. "

If need be, I can stop it for the day and jump right into the first part of an activity that coincides with it.  Sometimes it is nice to push that pause button that can not be pushed on a regular field trip.  When you have so many students who are experiencing things for the first time it is great to be able to give them the extra input they might need. \n\nI hope you will help build our collection of ""field trips"" by helping us with this project.  Help my students ""roar"" through reading and science using these wonderful resources."
Help Us Organize With Graphic Organizers!,"Our Title I elementary school in Texas serves approximately one thousand students, ninety-three percent at poverty level and eighty-four percent at risk.

The Literacy Academy Committee for first- and second-grade students will guide an additional instructional block of time for implementing innovative literacy enrichment.  The Committee has designed engaging literacy sessions built around the theme of classic fairy tales and storybooks aiming to help the seven first-grade and six second-grade teachers implement instructional units with all the materials needed to help students build oral language development, vocabulary, reading comprehension, fluency and writing competency through flexible project-oriented activities with a final celebration and sharing of the final project.  With a strong, dedicated Literacy Committee, we are able to create the innovative format of the program, but how to obtain the funds for implementation is our constant struggle.  Our principal is trying to save monies to begin a much needed Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA) program. \n\nThe reusaable write-on set of graphic organizers  we are requesting is only part of the Literacy Academy’s needs to create thirteen units (for thirteen teachers) based on classic folktales and literature. The organizers are essential in helping students understand concepts and connect ideas visually which might be otherwise seen disconnected. They will furthermore be used at different times during the instructional blocks.  \n\nThe teaching units will be rotated among the teachers with each teacher implementing a total of six projects during the school year and will be comprised of the following instructional blocks:  read aloud/think alouds, vocabulary building, character and setting sketching, compare/contrast, sequencing, summarization, and a project as a grand finale to be celebrated and shared by students and parents in the first and second grades. These could include puppet shows with different story endings, new written version of the tales, enactment of the stories, etc.  One of the goals of the Literacy Academy Committee is to provide teachers with the needed materials and resource activities to facilitate implementation with enthusiasm, yet allowing flexibility in teaching.

I teach 3rd grade students in a low-income area at an art charter school that receives a lower amount of funding than public schools. My students enjoy learning about music, but our budget does not include supplies for a music program, including musical books. \n\nReading can be a struggle for some of my students. Now that they are excited about learning music, this is the perfect time to expose them to musical books. By combining literature and music, my students will expand their knowledge of different musical genres and increase their reading skills and vocabulary. \n\nStories like, ‘Peter and the Wolf’, and “The Carnival of the Animals’ not only show students how music and literature work well together but also introduces students to the powerful connection of different instruments to different characters. In addition, our requested music books have great musical terms to help my students better understand music vocabulary. The musical scarves will help in lessons of music and movement and to further show how music tells stories.\n\nThis is not only my request but the request of 20 eight year olds who helped select these musical books. By donating to our class you will be enriching the musical talent of these students and so many more to come. Music...it's all around you. Some say music begins where words ends. Can you hear it?"

These interactive flash cards will help my students be active, engaged learners.","Today’s children are surrounded by technology and live in a visually rich world- flashy video games, computers, HD televisions, 3D movies…  It is a challenge to keep children engaged in the classroom through materials that capture their attention and make learning fun for them.   \n\nWe are a class of enthusiastic 3rd graders and a fun-loving teacher that find learning exciting!  They are like little sponges absorbing EVERYTHING I can teach them, and finding new things to learn on their own and from each other.  We work & learn together in a Title I school with a very high percentage of students and families living in low income homes.  Our school has a large group of ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) students. While poverty and language can present big barriers for students, we are learning not to let our challenges get in the way of learning or loving life.  I strive each day to help my students find joy in their lives and in being together and learning.  Our class is a wonderful place to be! \n\nThe materials in this proposal are flash cards with a twist!  The reading comprehension sets present children with short reading passages that focus on particular reading skills (main idea, sequencing events, etc.).  Children have questions to answer about their passage and they use a “hot dot wand” to choose the answer.  The wand gives immediate feedback to the students by lighting up with a green or red light and making sounds to indicate correct or incorrect answers.  The phonics cards will be very similar only focus on phonics/decoding skills appropriate for my struggling readers.  These cards will help my students practice grade level reading skills, provide them opportunities to practice & improve their comprehension and reading, and will better prepare them for the end of grade tests which will be very similar in format.  They will do all this in a fun, engaging way that allows children to have immediate feedback, find and fix errors, and feel in control of their learning.  \n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw said, ""What we want is to see the child in pursuit of knowledge, and not knowledge in pursuit of the child."" This is the goal- children who are eager to learn, who LOVE to ask questions and always want to know more. Our future generations will be led by the children in school now. You can help my children learn and reach their goals. Will you help us? We need you. "

My students do not live in close proximity to a public library and depend on their school library for access to books they like to read. \n\nEach year the library sponsors a school book award to encourage our students to read. The list of 20 books is carefully selected over a year long process by the librarian and a team of teachers in the building.  The list is revealed in May and students are encouraged to read as many titles from the list as they can before the election the following April. Over the past two years 850 students have participated in the election process.  \n\nWith multiple copies of each title available in the library I am sure we will continue to increase student participation. The list of titles is carefully selected to support a range of interests and ability levels. In addition, access to new audio versions of some of the titles will allow for participation in the program to students who are not able to read the books independently. \n\nYour contribution will ensure that our students continue to read and be excited about books. The skills they develop through regular independent reading will increase their overall skill and improve their performance in all subjects. "

My school uses the Responsive Classroom approach to teaching and building community is a very important component.  Social skills are taught along side of academics.  Because of this approach, our high needs school has become a safe, home away from home for many students.  Having a large meeting area is more conducive to community building than sitting at tables or desks and will encourage these diverse learners to come together. \n\nThe rug I am requesting is a large, comfortable rug that my entire class can sit on at once.    We will use it when we come together each morning as a community for Morning Meeting.  It will also be used for focus lessons and small group work.  During reading, students will sprawl out and get comfortable with a good book. During Math and Science, students will use the are for extra space so that they can really spread out with partners while they work.   \n\nThis simple rug will be our 'special place' in our classroom. It might be hard to believe the difference a rug makes, but trust me, it will be where we build our community, learn our most important lessons, and share about our lives.  It will make the hours we spend away from home feel more comfortable and relaxing.   "

It is always difficult (and expensive) to find engaging, well-written young adult novels that are not too difficult for my students to read. \n\nMy students are predominantly Latino and African-American. They attend a public high school that is centrally located in a large city. 95% of the students in the school come from low-income households. My students are highly motivated to improve their reading skills. Many of them already have a passion for reading, but are overwhelmed by the difficulty of most novels written for teens their age. Others have grown to dislike reading after years of frustration with their own reading deficits. My goal is to expose them to high-quality young adult novels that will inspire them to become better readers. \n\nI am requesting four sets of young adult novels that my class will be able to read and experience together. I have selected novels that are intended for high school students, but are written at 3rd-4th grade reading levels. The novels cover a range of genres, from historical fiction to vampire fantasy. All of the books feature teen protagonists facing difficult issues such as depression, peer pressure, and identity crises. I believe that these novels will capture the attention of my students, and will hopefully inspire them to read more difficult and extensive texts in the future. \n\nThis project will have a profound impact on my students. They will be exposed to new worlds and ways of life that they have not thought about before. They will begin to realize that working to improve their reading skills does not always have to be excruciating and boring. They will discover that it's possible to find enjoyment in a great story while expanding their vocabulary, improving their reading fluency, and dealing with social-emotional issues that are affecting their lives.

Do you have a comfy pillow or chair you prefer to read at? My students would love to have some comfy pillows in our class book nook to sit on or against as they read. \n\nMy fourth grade students are such a joy! They come to school eager to learn and talk about their books. \n\nThere are twenty-two students in my classroom, eleven girls and eleven boys. They attend a metropolitan public school in Minnesota. My students love to sit in our book nook and read. \n\nAs the school year begins, we are continuing to build my students' reading stamina and genre interest. I have requested five pillows for our classroom library because it will help my students be more comfortable and minimize sitting adjustments - distracting them from their books. \n\nAllowing students to have a comfortable and positive reading experience promotes literacy and allows students to focus more of their time reading - and less time situating themselves. \n\nAdding pillows to our book nook will make it more aesthetic and welcoming to hesitant readers. Students will enjoy sitting comfortably with the support of the pillow allowing them to focus on their reading.  \n\nYour donations will promote a positive reading experience and help develop life long readers.

","Each day I'm greeted with energetic and excited 3-4 year olds eager to start their day. My students are predominately ELL, I work to develop their communication skills, independence, and an awareness of the world. I believe children learn by doing and seeing; what better way to learn about animals?\n\nMy classroom is diverse, with an Hispanic dominance.  They are all eager and wide-eyed 3 year olds, filled with lots of questions and energy.  They talk about everything, and even though they have the language barrier, it doesn't inhibit their exploratory nature.  \n\nI introduce my students to letters, sounds, numbers, music, art, and science on a daily basis.  My school is located in a low income area but our parents and staff work cohesively to develop pride and respect in our students toward their academic achievements.\n\nWe did achieve a Gold Star for our academic progression in 2012-2013 and we are working exceptionally hard to acquire an additional status for 2013-2014.  Our school is comprised of 86% Hispanic, 8% African-American, and 6% Caucasian with over 57% of our students being ELL learners. We provide our students with the tools and instructional atmosphere to achieve the highest academic goals from Pre-K tots through grade 5.\n\nOur students will learn how to properly care for several species of animals, including but not limited to: llamas, peacocks, rabbits, tortoises and ponies.  They will listen and learn about the types of foods each animal eats, the feeding schedules, and the maintenance required as far as grooming and cleaning their habitats.  \n\nThe children will learn how the animals are cared for when they become ill and see that they must take medicine also to make them better. The children will then have an opportunity to feed several animals by hand.  Finally each child will be given a pony ride around the stable, guided by one of the ranch hands.  Overall I believe this would be an exciting and awesome experience for my beautiful, wide-eyed 3 and 4 year old students, who are just beginning to learn about the wonders of our world. \n\nOur students live in an economically low income area, where one or both parents may be unemployed; this may prevent them from indulging in such educational trips.  Your donations will help insure the attendance of all our students on such an awesome, adventurous experience.  After the trip we will compile a class book to commemorate our experience, and allow the students to revisit the experience over and over again. "

Just imagine an activity where the child gets to reach into a cloth bag and needs to feel the shapes in order to identify a particular shape.  I can envision smiles on the children's faces as they learn about shapes and understand shape properties.\n    With six second grade classes needing to teach shapes, it would be wonderful if I could get three sets of 3-D shapes. This will allow two classes to share a set.  All 145 second graders will get to enjoy the opportunity to use these materials. Experiences with concrete shapes will build visualization skills necessary for learning and functioning in the real world.\n    Thanks again for taking your time to read my proposal and giving consideration to providing 3-D geometric shapes.

We are a low-income school that is ethnically diverse. My sixth graders are enthusiastic and energetic. Many are performing below grade level in reading and math, so it's important that we take action NOW to help them catch up so they can succeed in high school, college, and beyond. \n\nI am requesting a binder for each student, along with highlighters and the copy paper in order to create folders with all of the CST released questions for students. These binders will help prepare them for the test, and give them a way to keep all their test-prep materials organized in one place. Students will also be more motivated if they have a nice binder and highlighters to use to study and prepare. The paper is vital, since each student will receive about 100 pages of resources each. If we do not get extra paper, we will not have enough to give them these resources to prepare for the test. \n\nThis project is important for the future of our school and our students. Our students need to raise their test scores for various reasons; to exit ESL, to get into honors classes, and for our school to remain independent of outside control. By donating to this project, you are preparing our students for testing in May so they can be confident and ready come test day! Thank you! "

Their minds are ready for the voyage. Books are an essential part of our trip, as they open up new worlds and ideas for students. My students need quality reading material to enjoy and enhance instruction. \n\nThe students that I teach are intelligent, capable, and strong. They have just as much street smarts as they do book smarts. Their community is considered a ""high poverty"" area, however it is filled with hard working parents that do desire a better life for their children. My students enjoy learning, most of all reading. They are Kindergarten students and they love school. For them, school is a place where they can learn, express themselves and grow as individuals. It is amazing to see the transformation that takes place in them as we go through the school year. Our school would be considered small by most. We have around 400 students and there is a strong presence of the community seen and felt in our school. Many parents volunteer their time to support our school in any way they are asked. \n\nI believe that the reading materials and art supplies I have chosen for my students will create lasting Kindergarten memories for them.  Many of the students that enter my Kindergarten classroom have not had much exposure to quality reading material.  As a result, books introduce them to characters and situations that inspire, humor, and teach them new things. I also chose to include art supplies in my project because I believe my students will be artistically inspired after being introduced to so many new books. Naturally, being Kindergarten students, they love to paint. \n\nIt is hard to express in words what funding for this project would mean to my students. I have acquired a small library of books since I began teaching 10 years ago. There are still however, many books that I desire to share with my students.  I believe I have chosen books that will cover a wide range of my students' interests.  This project will not only benefit the students in my class this year but for years to come. "

All my students have disabilities which range from mild being able to communicate but need help acquiring new skills such as learning numbers and shapes while my other students can't communicate with words.  My students attend a public preschool center in North Carolina which is funded by the school system. They enjoy going to school learning new concepts just like other preschoolers. Because of limited funds my students do not receive any materials from our school or the school system. Teachers donate their own money to give items that enhance students learning. Currently all of the materials in the classroom are missing pieces. There are no activities for children who need challenging tasks such as writing, learn their letters, and to count they need hands on materials.  These skills are imperative to be successful in kindergarten with their typical peers which determines their entire future. \n\nCan you help me provide  hands on learning materials to my preschoolers with special needs so they can reach their fullest potential? We are need of items such as math/pattern games, alphabet games, beads for lacing, and art supplies to make a collage that makes the letters in their name so our children have fun ways to learn essential concepts they need to know when they reach educational goals. With these resources my students will learn to recognize their letters, their lunch number, develop fine motor skills to be able to write their name and tie their shoes.  All of these skills will prepare them to be with their typical peers in kindergarten and their educational future. If they are able to be with their typical peers there are more possibilities for their education and their future as an effective citizen in their local community. \n\nYour support of our project will provide my preschoolers who have special needs an opportunity to utilize hands on educational materials grasp concepts they need to be successful in kindergarten with typical peers. Seeing the smiles on their faces when they can write their name and hear them say I did it will show how my students are forever grateful for giving them a chance to gain the best education because of your donation of hands on learning materials.Thank you for investing in my students.

A listening center would help level the playing field for all the students of my class. This technology will benefit especially the reluctant reader or low achieving student. It will allow them to listen to a good reader while following along in their book.  \n\nMy students are all second language learners who struggle to achieve success in school. All of them are either first generation Americans or new arrivals with high economic disparity. Our school is in a high poverty urban environment with limited resources. Teaching is a labor of love, most of our classroom supplies come out of the teacher's pocket with little or no support from the district.  \n\nHaving a listening station in the classroom frees me to hone in on guided reading and allows the students relaxed time to ""read"" a book. In addition, it will help improve my students reading scores. The students will use the listening station during the reading block and will listen to a chapter book or a picture book daily. They are free to listen to the selection repeatedly during their time at that center and follow up with comprehension questions of the reading. The center will also be used by the children with the purpose of reading for enjoyment. I believe this resource will foster a love of reading and passion for books in these young children. \n \n\nI can't begin to explain the urgency this listening center has in my class. This technology will impact reading scores on high stakes exams and it will also create a love of reading.

Now it is time to add another more important dimension and begin to build upon their self-esteem, in order for them to make their dreams and passions a reality. \n\n""Ramona Quimby Age 8"" will be the second set of independent leveled readers for our classroom that will be themed around strong and empowered female characters. The small group lessons for these sets of books will foster inspiration and respect for women. Moreover, students will improve their reading and comprehension skills while developing a passion for reading. \n\nIn conjunction with building an appreciation for reading, this literature will allow my students to see the accomplishments of the main characters in these stories and allow them to begin thinking about their passions and setting future goals. \n\n""The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams."" -Eleanor Roosevelt "
Building A Business Technology Library!,"Exposure to business and success is very minimal.  My plans are to bring back the Introduction to Business class in our program.  Until that happens, I am planning to implement different types of business related reading material into my classes.",My students need many business & technology related books to start a business reading library.  These books range from how to write a business plan to successful people in business. ,"If you can't read about people and success in business........how do you know it's out there?  I teach Computer Applications in grades 9-12 in a rural, high-poverty area area in Tennessee. \n\nExposure to business and success is very minimal.  My plans are to bring back the Introduction to Business class in our program.  Until that happens, I am planning to implement different types of business related reading material into my classes. \n\nI plan on stocking my room with many different types of business/technology related books that students can check out and read anytime they wish. My students especially need ""How to write a Business Plan"".  I can use this book to discuss and teach how to develop a business and incorporate lessons from the Computer Applications class.  I want my students to have big dreams for themselves.  The only way I can teach that to them now is verbally.  By having these books in the classroom, I can physically pull a book from the shelf and say ""read this"", it will help you see how people have and create success and that you can achieve it also. Some of the books I have chosen are from John Maxwell\n""Leadership 101"", ""Ethics"", ""Attitude"", and ""Success"".  I have also chosen ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"", ""The Millionaire Next Door"", ""48 Days To The Job You Love"", and others from Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, and Dave Ramsey. I have also selected the Microsoft Office 2003 set for ""dummies"".  Computers require lots of patience, especially when the applications aren't working properly.  By having this set I can teach students how to ""look up"" the answers instead of always on me to tell them. \n\nYou can help my students dreams become a reality by supplying them with the necessary reading tools and teach them to be independent learners.  I feel this is one of the most important projects I have posted and after reading it...hope you will also."
Keyboards For Kids,My project needs a set of 30 learning keyboards and 30 computer mice that will help them learn how to use the computer properly and allow them to excel in the computer lab. The learning keyboards and mice will make a significant difference in the way that students...,My students need a set of 30 learning keyboards and 30 computer mice that will help them learn how to use the computer properly and allow them to excel in the computer lab.,"No one can argue about the importance of effectively using the computer keyboard. As adults we use the computer in our daily routines.  Learning how to use the keyboard can be so confusing!  Wouldn't it be great if there was a keyboard that make it a little less confusing for students?  \n\nI am a computer teacher at an high need, urban school in New Jersey.  I teach students from kindergarten through fifth grade.  My students are great!  They love coming to the computer lab.  It is very exciting for them.  They are eager to learn.  Many of them do not own a computer at home, so coming to the computer lab is a big deal for them.  The difficult thing about using the computer is that the letters are scattered everywhere.  Students that are just learning how to use the computer are sometimes easily confused and discouraged.  These learning keyboards help to solve some of these issues. They are very motivating and easy to visually discriminate even for students with special needs.    \n\nWe need a set of 30 learning keyboards and 30 computer mice that will help them learn how to use the computer properly and allow them to excel in the computer lab. The learning keyboards and mice will make a significant difference in the way that students interact with the computer.  These educational keyboards will be perfect for my kindergarten students that are just being introduced to the computer.  It can be so overwhelming for many of them. I know that this resource will be a big help and make a huge difference!  \n\nWhen we work with programs such as Keybo that help students how to type properly, it will be more fun rather than a chore.  It will also be less intimidating with a color coded keyboard.  Since many of them have difficulty remembering their left from their right, the color coded mouse will be ideal in helping them hold the mouse correctly and click where they are supposed to.  We use a variety of programs in the our computer lab, including StoryBook Weaver, KidPix 4, PowerPoint, Excel, Word, and PhotoStory 3.  I know that these wonderful keyboards will be very helpful not only to my younger students, but to the entire school. \n\nYour help and generosity will make a huge difference.   My students will be able to learn more effectively and work more efficiently because they will be able to learn the proper way to type more easily.  I feel that it is so important to learn the proper way to do things from the start, rather than learn the wrong way and confuse them later.  With these educational keyboards, students will feel more comfortable and will be able to excel with working on the computer. "
Special Needs Students Deserve a Fighting Chance,"Obstacles don't have to stop you. Find a way to climb it,or go through it"". A horse & a turtle are to race.

A document camera will be greatly beneficial for my students that have various learning disabilities.,"Obstacles don't have to stop you. Find a way to climb it,or go through it"". A horse & a  turtle are to race. The siren sounds and they are required to be the first at the line. This seems daunting for the turtle, but his will encourages him. Like the turtle my kids are motivated to finish the race. \n\nI am a special education teacher at a public high school located in Southern California. Many of my students come from poverty stricken single parent homes, and gang and drug infested neighborhoods. I teach 32 students with various learning disabilities. Though, they have disabilities that may impede their learning they are strong willed and motivated students that are willing and able to take on any challenge.  Like their general education peers they have dreams and aspirations to go on to post-secondary schools, receive training in the military and to hold prestigious jobs to help their parents and support their communities. They are avid learners and is hopeful of their future. My students attend a charter school that serves the population of its community.  We serve a student body population of 700 students with 5%requiring special education and about 97% qualifying for free and reduced meals.  They are cognizant of their  disabilities, but remain goal oriented and active learners. \n\nI am fortunate to teach a group of talented students. I teach 9th-12th grade students in a resource support classroom. I also have a select group of students that I provide CAHSEE intervention to. The goal of the special education department is to excite our youth about post-secondary education and employment opportunities after high school. There are many new technological resources for special education teachers that need to be incorporated into our classes. As a special educator I strive to provide my students with high sensory instruction, meaningful learning experiences to help them to develop into great college students and young adults. I make extensive use of what ever new technology I can acquire. With this new technology my students can develop their own videos to teach each other as well as help them to produce numerous Power Point presentation. A document camera can improve the lives of my students because it can help the to better access the curriculum \n\nThis project will be beneficial to my students. Students with special needs are running a race similar to their general education counterparts. With this new and innovative technology we can begin to bridge the educational gaps for students with special needs. With the advancement of technology we are seeing the success of more students with disabilities further their education in post-secondary schools. Your generosity can inspire our youth to become productive college bound students. "
Writing Time,Simply by having a supply of high quality Ticonderoga pencils I can prevent the loss of instruction and work time by eliminating the time wasted dealing with pencils that won't sharpen.,My students need to have 100 boxes of Ticonderoga pencils.,"My classroom consists of twenty-seven 5th grade students. They range in race and economic need.\n\nWe are a school where over 1/3 of our population qualifies for free or reduced lunch.\nMy students need to have 100 boxes of Ticonderoga pencils to increase their writing time. Currently our time to write and work is being lost. My class is being provided pencils that will not sharpen. \n\nThe current pencils provided were purchased to save money, but instead of assisting the students, the low grade pencils hinder the learning process. 5 to 10 minutes of instruction are lost on a regular basis attempting to sharpen these pencils during the various subjects. \n\nSimply by having a supply of high quality Ticonderoga pencils I can prevent the loss of instruction and work time by eliminating the time wasted dealing with pencils that won't sharpen. \n\nPlease assist these brilliant young minds by giving them the full opportunity to learn!"

One challenge that you can help them with is by helping them become fluent readers. They are eager to learn how to read fluently and by having classic children's literature on CD they will be able to become the fluent readers that I know they can become. \n\nHaving modeled examples of what fluent reading sounds like will help them to practice reading fluently. Students will be able to listen to modeled reading. This will help them with their comprehension and ability to interact with books. With the new Common Core learning standards, students are expected to become fluent readers by the time they are ending 1st grade. Since children learn at different paces, some children need a little more guided help to help them achieve this goal.  \n\nWith your generous assistance my wonderful students will become great life long readers. This will help them in all aspects of their lives. Your help with bring my students to higher reading level, help them become confident readers and help them become readers for life!

Which would you choose? So would my students! Textbooks and workbooks aren't the way to teach my students. We need real life practice and technology. \n\nMy students attend a small rural public school. We are a self-contained intermediate (3rd-5th grade) life-skills classroom. My students have difficulties which range from developmental delays, to cognitive impairments, to autism. They love to learn, but traditional teaching methods simply don't work with them. We have to be innovative and creative in order to capture their attention and help them learn. \n\nOur non-traditional methods include a lot of real-world practice. We work on time by relating it to our classroom schedule. We work on money and social skills by taking community outings.  We practice sight words and vocabulary within themes.  \n\nSome of my students have difficulty navigating the classroom and a traditional computer. An iPad will provide students with independent practice of skills without waiting for someone to come help them. I also have students with behavioral challenges, and technology is often the great motivator for when tasks are completed. \n\nMy students are unable to access the typical curriculum of their peers. I am always looking for new and innovative ways to capture their attention, encourage positive behaviors, and inspire learning.

Imagine Your World Without Art,I want the artist's studio to be a place where my students are able to begin to tell their stories.

Growing up in a high needs community, navigating two languages and facing for the first time the rigors of high stakes standardized testing, my students, more than most, rely on the balance that creative expression provides. \n\nDue to the overwhelming number of students at our school, third graders do not receive any form of visual arts instruction. If you can't imagine being eight years old, with an emotion to express, a vision to share or a story to tell, and with no means, save a crayon and xerox paper with which to do it, envision helping to create a virtual artist's studio in that child's classroom ! \n\nMy plan is simple! I need easels, paint and paint brushes to establish an art center within my classroom. As a teacher with a strong background in the integration of the visual arts into the language arts curriculum I firmly believe that the arts are another language for learning. I want the artist's studio to be a place where my students are able to begin to tell their stories. This opportunity is especially vital for the children who struggle with translating their ideas into words on paper. So many of these children give up and leave the story telling to others, painting suggests another way for them to feel complete. \n\nIf I could make this studio a reality on my own I would have done so years ago. Please help my third graders now and in the years to come know the joy of painting and the satisfaction that art provides.

My students dream of graduating high school, and though many in our community doubt they can do so, I will never give up hope that each and every student WILL graduate Spring 2013.  \n\nMany of my students have never thought college as an option after high school, and majority of them would be first generation college students in their families. Our high school has recently been remodeled, and all the classrooms are equipped with SMART boards. However, my class will not receive calculators to use to perform complex higher level math concepts, and in a 12th grade math class, we are given ""Beginner's Algebra"" textbooks. This class (Math for college readiness) covers everything from pre-algebra, algebra I and II, geometry, and some trigonometry concepts. My students are placed in this class because they scored at or below P.E.R.T (Postsecondary Education Readiness Test) passing levels. Not being able to pass the P.E.R.T. signifies that students are not prepared to graduate and are performing below grade level.  \n\nThe resources I am asking donors to provide will help make a transformational change in my students' lives. The ACT prep books will help students not only prepare to retake the P.E.R.T, but they will help students prepare for the ACT, a stepping stone into college. Graphing lap boards and dry erase markers will make problems come to life and create differentiate learning possible with the countless concepts we will remediate throughout the year. Simple supplies like pencils, staplers, markers, organizers, etc. will help my attention be focused on student achievement rather than on where the funds for everyday supplies will come from. \n\nI believe in the capabilities of all my students. I know that they can all succeed, but we need help in making this goal a reality. The donations from this website will be used everyday in my classroom to help students alter the course of their lives after high school graduation. Once they realize that people in our community  believe in their capabilities too, they will have the self-confidence to achieve the academic success they deserve. "

It is not feasible to show my students these resources because they are unable to crowd around and adequately view. \nOur school system has also newly adopted a new math program. With the new program all transparencies and workbooks are available online so that students can follow along, and the teacher can demonstrate strategies and how to solve math problems. I am currently unable to utilize these resources due to the lack of a projector. \nMy students lives will be changed because they will be visually stimulated and engaged during all cross curricular lessons, and not just math.  \n\nI believe that this project is important because technology is the way of the future. I want my students to be able to visualize their work and also know how to use technology. A LCD projector will be able to engage my students for many years to come.

Most of my students come from very low economic family status. Many of these children face poverty, violence and obscenities of life on a daily basis, that are well beyond what most of us could imagine. Yet my students do their best to learn.\n\n\nI try my best to give them a good education and an introduction to the American way of life, but with limited resources there are many things that others consider basic parts of education that I cannot provide without assistance. Many of them never get the opportunity to leave not only the city of Bridgeport they live in, but also the state of Connecticut. Having the chance to let them explore and learn about our solar system and the U.S. space program,  will give them the opportunity to understand so much more about the world we live in. My students are the future leaders of today's world. Being able to explore the solar system and today's space program will give my students the opportunity to stretch their minds.  They will get the opportunity to imagine what it would be like to be an astronaut. Their inquisitive minds will one day help our world.  There may be a future astronaut among them. The solar system model I have requested will give my students the opportunity to see up close, how the planets are set up from the sun. The book, ""Out of this World Astronomy 50 Amazing Activities and Projects,"" will allow my students to collaborate together and create a project for our school science fair. \n\nSpace exploration will give my students the opportunity to broaden their knowledge. Using the Career Dress-up Costumes requested will give my students the opportunity to not only write responses to what they have read and seen, but also to share personal opinions with their fellow classmates, dressed up as an astronaut. They will be able to have the hands-on materials they need to see up close what they cannot see in space. \n\nThe Bill Nye Astronomy DVD will present my students with pictures and information to enhance their curiosity of space exploration.  The solar system bulletin board set will give us the chance to display and share what the students have learned with other students and staff in  our school. The video "" For All Mankind"", has scenes of our space program and footage of many of the journeys the US space program has made.  This video includes the footage of Neil Armstrong's monumental trip to the moon. Being able to share this video with my students, will give my them the opportunity to interact with one another, using accountable talk and cooperative group work, to bring the study of space exploration to life.\n\nWith your assistance, we can bring an expansion of knowledge and appreciation of all that is available to my students, to the young people, our future explorers. \n\nA supportive donation to fund the items I have chosen, could fund special programs in areas of Science and Arts, where students can  include planetarium research, or a science program where they would learn more about our planets, our solar system and space exploration. Can you imagine the fun they would have while learning too?!  And it could happen with your help and assistance\n\n"

Help me establish a science classroom that is fun and engaging to learn.","From the wonder of arranging a vast array of rocks and minerals to the discovery of systems in the human body, science can never truly come to life without rearranging the organs, touching the different rocks, and seeing how light bends. True learning happens when we can 'dig in'! \n\nI teach in a charter school located in the North East Los Angeles area. The majority of my students are Socially Economically Disadvantaged, minorities with the goal to make a difference and attend a college. The larger part of my students will be the first in their families to go to college. Being mostly underrepresented in science degree programs and science professions, it is important to me to ensure that all my students can get as much exposure to science as possible. Given the situation my students live in, they are not exposed to any real science at home or in their community and it is up to me to make sure that their experience is exciting enough for them to be interested in pursuing some kind of science, engineering, technology, or math profession. I am confident that, by experiencing the fun of science through hands-on activities, I will be to make their science experience motivating and enriching for all my students. \n\nDid you ever have a rock collection as a child? Imagine being able to have access to an array of different rocks you can touch, learn their names, and how they were formed! A rock will never seem the same after being able to handle and sort so many different types.\nHave you ever wondered how the body's organs look like inside the body if you where able to remove one or two? What if you were given all the organs and you had to figure out where in the body they belong? Your understanding of the body systems will be greatly enhance to a deeper level.\nAlso, can you remember playing with mirrors and light? By having the ability to 'play' with prisms and mirrors, common light becomes science! \nAll these inquiry activities lead to understanding science. With your help, my students can learn 1)optics with prisms, mirrors, and flashlights, 2)understand the systems of the human body with human body models, 3)identify and classify rocks with rock collections, droppers, a balance, and geodes. \n\nWith the majority of my students being Socially Economically Disadvantaged and underrepresented minorities, it is important to me that they are able to have the ability to find science worthwhile by having the inquiry based lessons in the classroom. With motivation and enthusiasm for the sciences, achievement increases and so does the potential for students to become professionals in science, engineering, technology, or mathematics "
Touching Technology,"My students need an Apple iPod Touch in the library so we can have a listening station permanently set up for student use.

Our students come from very diverse backgrounds, we have more English Language Learning (ELL) students than any other school in our county. Approximately 25% of our students come from economically disadvantaged homes and do not have the resources to provide technology at home. We celebrate our diversity, but since our children come from such different backgrounds, school is the one place to level the playing field by providing tools they will need to be successful and contributing members of our community. Using technology in the library brings a fresh and new approach to learning. \n\nProviding a listening station in the library would provide our students a place to listen to downloaded books. Students being able to listen to the book as they follow along with a print copy helps enhance their vocabulary, but most of all, helps them develop reading fluency and inflection. Using headphones and a splitter, groups of children could use the station at the same time. \n\nMany sites on the Internet have free downloads (books & apps) as well as over 800 universities with active iTunes U sites and most of these institutions distribute their content publicly. Students can learn about the Galapagos Islands or other places. In the Beyond Campus section, students can tour some of the world’s most famous museums or brush up on their leadership skills. Students can access a wealth of content from distinguished entities such as MoMA, the New York Public Library, Public Radio International, and PBS stations. An iPod Touch learning station could open whole worlds to our children! \n\nBecause so many of our students are ELL students or do not have access to reading materials at home, they have problems with vocabulary, pronunciation, fluency, and inflection when reading. Having an iPod learning station in the library could be used for remedial teaching, research, enrichment, or shared/paired reading with the audio going along with the print book. By hearing the book, the student is getting words two ways; through both the eyes and the ears. "
Fairytale Or Folktale?,"Growing up, many students have not had, the opportunity to read picture books, or have books read to them.

I am also a Subject Area Leader for Language Arts at my school. I teach two courses: reading and writing literacy block. I work in a very diverse school and teach students with various reading and writing levels. Many students come from a high-need community. \n\nMany of the children in our school have limited resources. Our school is struggling to reach the requirements in reading and writing set forth by No Child Left Behind. Many students have showed an interest in observing and analyzing fairytales and folktales. In addition they will be writing and publishing their own original fairytale picture books.  They will need to examine the characteristics of fairytales written by renowned authors in order to write their own stories.\n\nThroughout the course of this year, students have been reading and writing in different genres. In the upcoming month, students will have an intense genre study unit on fairytales and folktales, where they will analyze and compose their own original stories! In order to  teach this unit, I have to have students examine a variety of picture books.  I have exhausted the supplies at the school, and town libraries.  However, there are just not enough books for my 75 students. \n\nYour support will help the teachers in our school to teach the students about the the different genre of fairytales and folktales.  Growing up, many students have not had the opportunity to read picture books, or have books read to them.  With this set of picture books, students will now have the opportunity, that they might not have had as a child.  Reading these books will allow my students to share their experience with their younger brothers, sisters, and other youngsters they encounter in the years to come.  Please help my students experience this love of reading!"

The majority of them are raised to work hard and achieve what their parents did not have the opportunity to. However, they are not wealthy. Most of them would not even be considered middle class. Thus, their homes are not equipped with the electronic technology that people need in order to stay relevant and competitive in a world that thrives on technology change and advancement. They are far behind in the race and the gap continues to grow.\n \n\nThe first step is simply putting the tools in their hands. I have requested four Samsung Chromebooks - a ""mini"" version of a laptop designed first and foremost for basic computing needs like Internet use and research, word processing, and building presentations. They NEED computers. If I can procure 5-7 machines a year through different avenues. I'll have a full class set in 4 years. Then, each of my students can have the ability to research and create new information without having to wait our turn for the computer lab. They will acquire skills that will put them on the right path to actually competing for those open spots at the ""top tier"" high schools they want to get into. They will begin to gain confidence because they will have exponentially more power over their own learning.  \n \n\nNot to mention, technology draws them into wanting to learn. It's interactive and enticing. It's the first step in the path of closing the gap of the race they're losing without even being allowed to run. Once they're allowed to step up to the starting line, I'll be excited to say ""I don't know."" "

","Involve me and I will understand Forever..(Part 2)\n\nPicture Symbols enable students with communication difficulties to express their needs. I am a Speech and Language Teacher working with students who have communication difficulties such as Severe Articulation Problems, Expressive Language Delay, Autism and other conditions. Most of my students are K-2 and are really having great difficulties in expressing themselves.  These children come from poor families and do not have the resources or access to specific materials needed by these students. The schools (2 schools) where I work lack enough funds to supply my classes with the materials that I need for the special needs of my students. \n\nThere is a great program that has been proven to work effectively with children with autism (and other speech/language disorders) in facilitating communication. In fact, I have been using this system (Picture Symbol System) for 3 years now. To make these picture symbols, I used to print out colored symbols using my personal printer because the printers in my school are only black and white. The need for picture symbols for my students is increasing as their skills become more developed. This requires me to print out so many pictures in order to make a picture communication book. This situation encouraged me to submit a proposal asking for a colored printer a few months ago. My students and I felt very blessed when the proposal (Printer with ink) was fully funded through DonorsChoose.org. I want to help my students but then again, the same problem comes into my mind. With the large number of pictures to print out for each student in both of my schools, the ink that I currently have is obviously not enough. Both of my schools do not have enough funds to supply my classes with inks. \n\nIt would greatly help me and my classes to have sufficient supply of colored and black/white inks in both of my classroom so I can develop communication books without limitations. My individual students will then be able to have sufficient communication books with a plethora of beautiful colored symbols that will augment their communication skills not only in the classroom but at home and in the community. \n\nImagine that by helping us achieve sufficient supply of color and black/white inks, you are actually empowering our students with Special Needs (communication difficulties) such as children with Autism. The colorful picture communication books that I will be able to create for them will be their sole tool in getting in touch with the outside world. Without these colorful symbols, a child with autism would feel very helpless (an shown in tantrums) because he/she has no means of telling the people around him about his/her needs and wants. You will be making a great part in making our children with autism able to understand the world around them. This is because, through their way of communicating which is through the picture communication books, they are able to be involved in the society. Remember that, if we involve them, they will understand the world around them, forever."

The majority of our school is of Latino decent and many are English Language Learners. They benefit from visual aids in the classroom. My students are also motivated and they love technology. \n\nHaving an LCD projector will allow the students to visually learn how to research and evaluate their research about cyberbullying. It will also help them see how to create a website online. When they are finished with their websites, they will be able to present it to their classmates instead of keeping it to themselves. \n\nCyberbullying is becoming an increasingly serious issue among teens and this website will empower my students by informing them and helping them know how to protect themselves and their friends. My students have a lot of influence on their peers and I feel that this website will help many other teens in our school deal effectively with cyberbullying. The LCD projector is a tool that will make sure my students do an excellent job on the website so they will be proud to show it. "

Please help us! \n\nMy students attend a school district that stresses high academic achievement and one where the expectations that students attend school is very high.  The most common reason for low student achievement is absenteeism, usually most often during the winter months due to sickness.  Students do not like to miss school, they like working with their classmates and doing well. \n\nThe most important part of the learning process is school safety.  If the students are unsafe or are not well, it's hard to expect them to do well in school.  The transmission of illnesses runs rampant during the winter months and with school districts cutting budgets anywhere they can, things like tissues and hand sanitizer are the fist to be cut.  With your help, some of these problems can be curtailed. \n\nStudents need to be safe to do well in school.  Students need to be healthy to maximize the time that they have in school.

First - its main character, age 12, extends an invitation to my sixth graders to come into his world and experience its many vivid details -- its very life and color.  Second, the genre is historical but also a fantasy to engage the imaginations of all of my young students.  Third, it is an excellent way to reflect and affirm east Indian families among our classroom and local communities. \n\nCalifornia's schools were hit very hard economically.  We nearly lost our school librarians this year, so new class sets of novels are hard to come by in these lean economic times.  This purchase of a class set of novels will benefit more than 120 sixth graders by helping them to engage with their factual studies of ancient India by stimulating their highly active imaginations.  The protagonist is their age.  There are some elements of fantasy as well as history incorporated into the novel to keep their minds engrossed in the details of what ancient Indian life might have been like. The story will parallel our studies of ancient India -- thereby accomplishing multiple instructional goals in one prudent purchase! \n\nYour donation for the cost of this purchase  will ensure my students remain interested in both reading and history.  The novel will serve as a bridge to the factual content in their social studies text while exciting them about the characters and their adventures in a historical and magical setting."
A Thesaurus is a Find-A-Word-asaurus!,"The children's thesaurus is a vibrant, engaging resource. For these students, you would be making a tangible contribution to fostering a love of the English language. Expand a vocabulary and you're growing readers!",My students need 7 thesauruses. ,"I teach library classes at a Rhode Island urban elementary school for grades Pre-K through 6th. Here, library classes are one of the key classes for increasing students' language skills. Dictionaries and thesauri are not resting on shelves with these kids. \n\nLast year, I brought out the 7 thesauri we own, and worked with kids in grades 2-6.  They loved learning and playing with words like ""fabulous"" and ""benevolent.""  Many of our students do not realize the wealth of words out there beyond the basics ""good"" and ""nice."" We made word gardens and had contests to become ""Find-A-Saurus"" word experts. \n\nIn the library we only have a handful of children's thesauri. If we receive just these few, you're making it possible for students to work as partners rather than sharing them among 5 others. \n\nThe children's thesaurus is a vibrant, engaging resource.

When our classroom books travel from school to home and then to school again, they are subject to daily wear and tear, even while protected in Ziploc bags. Bruises happen, even from respectful readers! \n\nGetting a young reader hooked is the hard part of growing avid readers.  However, at our high achieving Title 1 school, we've done the hard part. My colleagues and I rejoice that we have at our school a culture of readers who love their stories, who recommend books to each other. \n\nIn September, I read aloud Ragweed to my fourth graders. After its closing lines, eager imaginations inquire, ""Which one is next in the series?""  Avi's initial book in the Tales of Dimwood Forest series, Ragweed, contains vivid characters whom my students have already come to care about, ache over, and cheer for. I take advantage of the momentum. The series is comprised of six titles, each building on the marvelous journeys of the most charismatic of literary mice (my apologies, Stuart Little). After getting hooked, my students will get real mileage out of the rest of the series. \n\nOur downfall is the inexpensive paperbacks that come through the traditional, school market, book order fliers.  These titles are high-interest and up-to-date, but after three or four readings, they are already deteriorating.  I wish it were it not so, but the cover begins to separate from the book, individual pages begin to come unglued, corners fray, and bindings curl. Sooner, rather than later, Poppy is in pieces, held together with rubber bands and mailing tape; it becomes too labor intensive to read.  Not intellectually, but physically!  Reluctant readers wouldn't go near such a dilapidated mess, but even kids who can recognize a ""well-loved book,"" eventually abandon tattered copies as well.\n\nWith library bindings, I see five times the shelf life. Check out my photo: the shoddy paperbacks on top are less than half as old as the hardbacks underneath! Five times as many readers will take these home each night, get lost in these memorable stories and spend more minutes reading. \n\nGive a lasting gift. Please help prevent the waste that comes from having to send unreadable books to the recycling bin.  A durable proper binding is a great necessity when you have books that travel leagues in backpacks, on buses, up and down, hither and yon.\n\nYou will help create the community that comes from the shared experience of a great book.  The more children that can read a book before it's destined for the dust bin the better.  Thank you! "

Diving Deeper into Reading,The expectations for student achievement are growing exponentially. We need challenging literature to beef up our curriculum and prepare students for the rigorous tests they will face next year....,My students need 30 copies each of 23 exemplar books related to the Common Core Standards.,"The expectations for student achievement are growing exponentially. We need challenging literature to beef up our curriculum and prepare students for the rigorous tests they will face next year.  \n\nOur students routinely come in reading below grade level. They need an opportunity to dive deep into good reading materials. These exemplar books will give them the challenge they need. Many are reading in English as their second language. With little support from home, school is where the majority of their daily reading takes place.  \n\nI am asking for classroom sets of Common Core Exemplar books as recommended by the state of Illinois. These range from fiction to non fiction as well as books students can read independently or as a read aloud.  Many are books not available in our school library. \n\nClassroom sets of these books will allow 8 teachers to dive deep into good literature and show our young students strategies good readers keep with them for a lifetime! Our school motto is Readers are Leaders....and we want a community of strong, thoughtful leaders in our future! "

They also need headsets and software. ","Exploring ideas and collaboration through technology is a world I didn't grow up in but I sure wish I had. I can't imagine how different my world would have been! In a world of state test demands I know how important it is for students to get the chance to be creative and learn!  \n\nStudents are bored with reading about history without any practical experience centered on the events themselves but don't you wish you had a time machine so that you could have travel back in time to experience these events first hand? That's what I want to bring to my students experiences. We are a high needs schools with students that are 87% free and reduced lunch, most of the wonder in their life happens within the walls of our classroom. We are a public school with little to no extra money for field trips. I need to help these students dream about a better life and engage them to want to life a life outside of what they know. DREAMS. Why not experience the world through the lens of stop motion animation. If I had a time machine will allow students to explore historical events while using stop motion animation to develop critical thinking and problem skills, as well as working collaborative with teams. Truly developing 21st century skills through the innovative use of technology. \n\nI am requesting web cams because they are much cheaper than digital cameras so I can have more to have more students working. The Adobe Premier is excellent software to work with and very user friendly. Headsets will allow my students to work closely with their projects and understand the application of sound...sound, by the way, that a class in Germany is collaborating with them to create! I want to open up their world and explode their imagination. 5th and 6th grade is a pivotal time where students either turn that corner to education or are lost to the system. I want to run with my students around that corner, down that road and right out into the crazy wild world of learning. \n\nI work hard to help bridge the digital divide and bring as much real world experiences as I can to my students, trying to give them a fighting chance in this global world. If I can show my students that there is a world of learning out there and that more can happen in school that just books and writing and paper then I can use innovation to inspire them and keep them on a path that will bring the world to them...instead of just sitting and watching the world through a video game.

What if you could capture that work in such a way, that it would be part of a digital record of your life. Imagine the power of reflective learning through exciting multi-media tools. \n\nOur school community is socially, racially, and economically diverse. We are a public charter school in a low-income community in California. Parents & students from all over our county seek out our school because of our dedicated staff & wonderful student body. Students at our school are dedicated to their education and are eager to learn new things and have engaging hands-on experiences. \n\nMy students need to have ownership of their portfolios to truly become reflective learners. These tools will give them the independence they need & ownership that they desire. Currently, to add to their portfolio, students must first give me the document, I take it home, scan, & then file it into their Evernote as time allows. If students want to add an image, the only option has been a grainy photo taken with my outdated cellphone. With these new tools, the students will become empowered to document their own learning. The multifunction printer will enable them to easily scan their independently selected works, that will then be added to their portfolio. The digital cameras will help them to visually document their learning, thus adding depth and perspective to their portfolios. In addition to portfolios, these tools can also be used for research, projects, and observational recording. \n\nImagine being able to look back at your work and reflect on your growth as a student and individual. These dreams can come true when students have the resources they need and the ownership that they desire. These kid friendly tools will engage them in the reflective process and help them to grow as learners. In addition, many of my students do not have access to this type of technology outside of school. By learning to use them in class, my students will be better prepared for 21st Century. "
